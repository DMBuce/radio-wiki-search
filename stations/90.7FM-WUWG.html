This station is one of several in the GPB system that also produces its own programming, however the vast majority is simulcast. This is also duplicated locally both by GPB's WJSP-FM, and now WGPB FM, with most NPR programming also carried by non-GPB station WABE FM 90.1 from nearby Atlanta. Several programs are now also duplicated on WRAS FM 88.5, most of whose broadcast day was involuntarily taken from GSU students in June 2014, resulting in programs like Morning Edition and All Things Considered being needlessly aired on five local stations at once for seven total hours every weekday. Originally licensed to the university and operated entirely by students, WUWG was transferred outright to GPB in 2004, though it is unclear under what circumstances. When GPB pulled broadcasting operations to their Atlanta offices in 2008, Dr. Brad Yates made advances to start a new student run radio station.","extract_html":"<p><b>WUWG</b> FM 90.7 is the radio station that formally broadcast at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia, and a part of the GPB Radio state network.
