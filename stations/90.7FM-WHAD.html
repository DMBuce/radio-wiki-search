Part of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR), it airs WPR's \"Ideas Network\", consisting of news and talk programming. Like the Milwaukee area's other NPR station, WUWM, the station airs BBC World Service in the overnight hours. WHAD maintains a local news staff and cut-ins outside the main WPR network, and the station's facilities, located on the seventh floor of 310 W. Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee, originate some programming for the network, including Kathleen Dunn's afternoon program until her retirement in the summer of 2017. WHAD has its own 414 studio line for Milwaukee callers to call into locally originated programs. Because of the lack of a sister station providing WPR's News and Classical Network to Milwaukee, WHAD provides the HD2 Classical Network via HD Radio to the market via their HD2 subchannel, which only differs from the News and Classical Network in having a full-classical format overlaying NPR and APM news programming exclusive to WUWM in the market; it became the market's only classical music station over the air in 2007 after WFMR abandoned the format commercially.","extract_html":"<p><b>WHAD</b> is a non-commercial radio station licensed to Delafield, Wisconsin and serving the Milwaukee metropolitan area.
