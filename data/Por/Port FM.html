<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Port_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Port FM</b> was a local radio station based in Timaru, New Zealand that broadcast throughout South Canterbury and the MacKenzie Country.  It also operated as a network with sister-stations in Ashburton and Oamaru  known as 'Port FM Local'. Port FM's music genre was contemporary rock and pop, with the bulk of the weekday playlist made up of music from the mid eighties through the early nineties. The main (Timaru based) station was used as a network feed for Port FM Local in Ashburton and Oamaru during breakfast, nights and weekends.</p><p>Port FM ceased trading as an independent radio station on 30 April 2018, and is now under the Mediaworks branch of stations. The Port FM frequency is now broadcasting a South Canterbury version of More FM, with local content between 10am and 3pm weekdays. </p><p>The Port FM network was based in Timaru and was heard throughout South Canterbury and the MacKenzie Country. In 2006, two other stations owned by Port FM in Ashburton and Oamaru were renamed Port FM Regional.  They were originally known as Fox FM (Ashburton) and Whitestone 100FM (Oamaru), broadcasting locally during the day and at nights relaying the Port FM feed programme from Timaru.  The network used a tagline of 'Live, Local and Loving It'. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.portfm.co.nz/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.portfm<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz</a></span> (redirects to More FM)<pre># port fm (south canterbury, new zealand)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Port FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image" data-mw='{"caption":"Port FM Logo 2015"}'><a href="./File:Port_FM_Logo_2015.png"><img resource="./File:Port_FM_Logo_2015.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Port_FM_Logo_2015.png" data-file-width="166" data-file-height="50" data-file-type="bitmap" height="62" width="205"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./South_Canterbury" title="South Canterbury">South Canterbury</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_contemporary_music" title="Adult contemporary music">Adult contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">Terrestrial/Internet</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.portfm.co.nz/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.portfm<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz</a></span> (redirects to More FM)</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
