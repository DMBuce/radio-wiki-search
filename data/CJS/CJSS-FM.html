The station broadcasts a classic hits format branded as <i>Boom 101.9</i>. CJSS-FM is owned by Corus Entertainment, who acquired the station, along with CFLG, in 2001.</p><p>The station was launched in 1945 by the city's daily newspaper, the <i>Cornwall Standard-Freeholder</i>, with the call sign <b>CKSF</b>, originally at 1230 kHz with 250 watts and later in 1958, moved to 1220 kHz with 1000 watts using a directional array located at a site on part of Lot 7, Concession 4 in the Township of Cornwall.  In 1957, the newspaper also launched CKSF-FM. Two years later, the stations were acquired by Stanley Shankman, the owner of CJSS-TV, and both changed their callsigns to CJSS as well. </p><p>By 1963, Shenkman had sold his broadcast holdings. Ernie Bushnell purchased CJSS-TV 8, using it as a repeater of Ottawa's CJOH-TV; the radio stations were sold to the local Émard family. </p><p>The radio stations were subsequently acquired by Tri-Co Broadcasting Ltd. in 1978. Tri-Co Broadcasting Ltd. converted CJSS to the FM band in 1999. CJSS' former frequency, 1220 AM, did not go dark, but changed to an adult standards format as CJUL ("The Jewel"). </p><p>On August 18, 2010, CJUL (AM 1220) left the air. Corus stated that more listeners across Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry would now get up-to-date local and regional information on local radio as Corus Radio redeployed news and community event information from AM 1220 (CJUL) onto its two FM stations, CJSS-FM, and CFLG-FM.</p><p>After the flip from AM to the FM band in 1999, CJSS-FM aired a country music station branded as <i>Blaze 101.9 FM</i>. On August 8, 2003, the station shifted to an active rock format, branded as <i>Rock 101.9 FM</i>. </p><p>On February 15, 2011, CJSS-FM changed its format to classic hits, branded as "Greatest Hits 101.9 FM". </p><p>On August 25, 2014, at 3PM, CJSS-FM rebranded as <i>Boom 101.9</i>. The last song on "Greatest Hits" was "Revolution" by The Beatles, while the first song on "Boom" was "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey. </p><p>Also on August 25, 2014, Dan Allaire and Bill Halman teamed up to become the "Boom Breakfast with Dan &amp; Bill". Tom Schoch was introduced as the stations new midday host, followed by local favorite Darryl Adams in Afternoon Drive slot. </p><p>By October 24, 2014, Bill Halman was named Program Director for both CJSS-FM and CFLG-FM which had been re-branded as "Fresh FM" the same day as "Boom" had been. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.boom1019.com/?refresh=73707" class="external text">Listen Live</a><pre># cjss-fm (cornwall, ontario)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CJSS-FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:Boom_101_9_logo.png"><img resource="./File:Boom_101_9_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Boom_101_9_logo.png/250px-Boom_101_9_logo.png" data-file-width="447" data-file-height="223" data-file-type="bitmap" height="125" width="250" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Boom_101_9_logo.png/375px-Boom_101_9_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Boom_101_9_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Cornwall,_Ontario" title="Cornwall, Ontario">Cornwall, Ontario</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>101.9 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Hertz" title="Hertz">MHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_radio" title="FM radio" class="mw-redirect">FM</a>)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Boom_FM" title="Boom FM">Boom</a> 101.9</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>70s, 80s, 90s</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Classic_hits" title="Classic hits">Classic hits</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Corus_Entertainment" title="Corus Entertainment">Corus Entertainment</a> <br>(Corus Premium Television Ltd.)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CFLG-FM" title="CFLG-FM">CFLG-FM</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CJUL" title="CJUL">CJUL</a> (defunct)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1945 as CKSF</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former frequencies</div></th><td>1230 KHz (1945-1958) 1220 KHz (1958-1999)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td>CJ <b>S</b>tanley <b>S</b>hankman (original owner)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>3,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.boom1019.com/?refresh=73707" class="external text">Listen Live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.boom1019.com" class="external text">boom1019.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
