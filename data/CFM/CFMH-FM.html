<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CFMH-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CFMH-FM</b> is a Canadian radio station broadcasting at 107.3 MHz in Saint John, New Brunswick. It is the campus-based community radio station at the University of New Brunswick Saint John. CFMH-FM's studios and offices are located in the Thomas J. Condon Student Centre on the UNB Saint John campus in the North End of Saint John. </p><p>CFMH-FM is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association (NCRA). The station has hosted the 2002 and 2015 editions of National Campus and Community Radio Conference, an annual national gathering of community-oriented radio broadcasters that also hosts the annual general meeting of the NCRA. </p><p>The station was originally known as CRSJ and was available to Fundy Cable subscribers in the greater Saint John area on 104.1 MHz via cable in the 1980s and early 1990s, switching to a very low power distribution to loudspeakers in the main cafeteria and the Ward Chipman Library in the mid 1990s before its push to achieve official broadcasting status. </p><p>The station launched as CFMH in May 2000 on 92.5 FM, and adopted its current frequency on October 29, 2007. On August 14, 2010, CFMH-FM changed their branding and logo becoming LOCAL-FM. This change in branding represents the station's position as the alternative voice of the greater Saint John area with more local DJs and local programming than any other Saint John radio station.  </p><p>Local FM hosts the annual Best of Saint John Music Awards, which celebrates and recognizes the achievements of independent and emerging musicians in Saint John. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://localfm.ca/" class="external text">localfm.ca</a><pre># cfmh-fm (saint john, new brunswick, canada)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CFMH-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Saint_John,_New_Brunswick" title="Saint John, New Brunswick">Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, Canada</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>107.3 MHz (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_radio" title="FM radio" class="mw-redirect">FM</a>)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Local 107.3 FM</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Campus_radio" title="Campus radio">Campus radio</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Community_Radio" title="Community Radio" class="mw-redirect">Community Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2001_in_radio" title="2001 in radio">2001</a> (radio club in 1972)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>250 watts</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>50.5 meters (166<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>ft)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://localfm.ca/" class="external text">localfm.ca</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
