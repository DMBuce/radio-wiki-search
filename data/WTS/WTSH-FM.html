<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WTSH-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WTSH-FM</b> 107.1, branded as <b>La Raza 102.3/107.1</b>, is an FM radio station in northwest Georgia, and reaching into northwest metro Atlanta, Georgia.  Originally assigned to Rockmart, its city of license is now Aragon, west-northwest of Atlanta, and east of Rockmart.  The broadcast licensee is Woman's World Broadcasting and operated by Rome Radio Partners, LLC. From June 23, 2014 to September 24, 2018, it was operated by Cox Media Group via a local marketing agreement (LMA).  The station's supposed main studio is located on John Davenport Drive in Rome, Georgia. </p><p>On June 9, 2014, Women's World Broadcasting announced it would turn over operation of country music "<b>South 107</b>" to Cox Media Group via an LMA. On June 22 of that year, WTSH ended its country format after over 25 years and began stunting with a liner redirecting listeners to WSRM FM as "South 93.5".  On June 23, Cox Media Group started to assume control of 107.1 via LMA. Upon Cox taking over at midnight, 107.1 then flipped to alternative rock as <i>X107.1</i>, similar to the then-recently launched "X107.3" in Orlando, Florida. The first song on X107.1 was <i>Fever</i> by The Black Keys. Despite mostly covering outside of the Atlanta metro area (even with the "translator" station's coverage included), it identifies itself entirely as an Atlanta station during on-air promos.  The station ID included all three stations at the top of each hour: "WTSH-FM Aragon, W296BB Jonesboro, WSB-FM HD3 Atlanta". </p><p>Just over a year later, on June 29, 2015, WTSH went back to their heritage country format, simulcasting WNGC as <i>106.1/107.1 Your Georgia Country</i>. The change comes as X107.1 failed to gain any traction up against WRDA/WRDG generating only a 0.5 share in the May 2015 Nielsen Audio ratings.</p><p>On September 24, 2018, WTSH-FM (as a result of the LMA with Cox Media Group ending) switched from a simulcast with country-formatted WNGC to a simulcast with regional Mexican-formatted WLKQ-FM in Buford, branded as "La Raza 102.3/107.1".</p><p>The LMA and the "translator" station allowed Cox to circumvent restrictions on the excessive concentration of media ownership in the Atlanta media market. Since the "translator" station is not attributable under the FCC rules, and the main station's official service contour does not overlap Cox's WSRV FM 97.1 to the northeast or that of Cox's WALR-FM 104.1 to the southwest, it allows Cox to exceed the cap through technicalities and loopholes.  Locally, Cox also owns WSB AM 750 and its simulcast on WSBB-FM 95.5, as well as WSB-FM 98.5, WSB-TV 39 (2.1 and 2.2), and the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.lightningstream.com/Player.aspx?call=WLKQ-FM" class="external text">Listen Live</a><pre># wtsh-fm (aragon, georgia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WTSH-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;font-size:100%; background-color: #bfdfff;">Satellite of <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./WLKQ-FM" title="WLKQ-FM">WLKQ-FM</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Buford,_Georgia" title="Buford, Georgia">Buford</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Aragon,_Georgia" title="Aragon, Georgia">Aragon, Georgia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Northwest_Georgia" title="Northwest Georgia" class="mw-redirect">NW Georgia</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Rome,_Georgia" title="Rome, Georgia">Rome</a> / <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Metro_Atlanta" title="Metro Atlanta" class="mw-redirect">metro Atlanta</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>107.1 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td><i>La Raza 102.3/107.1</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Regional_Mexican" title="Regional Mexican">Regional Mexican</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Davis_Broadcasting" title="Davis Broadcasting" class="new">Davis Broadcasting</a> (via <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Local_marketing_agreement" title="Local marketing agreement">LMA</a>) <br>(Woman's World Broadcasting)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1972_in_radio" title="1972 in radio">1972</a> (as WZOT)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WZOT (1972–1989)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td>Transfiguration of <b>S</b>ou<b>TH</b> 107, which it was known as until June 2014</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>7043</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">C1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>100,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>158<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>m (518<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>ft)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.lightningstream.com/Player.aspx?call=WLKQ-FM" class="external text">Listen Live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.laraza1023.com" class="external text">laraza1023.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
