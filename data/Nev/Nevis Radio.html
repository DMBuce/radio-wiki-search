<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Nevis_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p><b>Nevis Community Radio Ltd (Nevis Radio)</b> is a community radio station broadcasting from Fort William in Scotland, serving the communities of Fort William and the surrounding region of Lochaber including Fort Augustus, Mallaig, Kinlochleven and parts of the Isle of Skye. </p><p>Nevis Radio is a registered charity with OSCR No. SC044464. </p><p>Nevis Radio broadcasts 24 hours a day from its base in the Ben Nevis Industrial Estate, Fort William, with original local programming for part of the day, and automated repeats and music service at other times. The station started out in 1992 as Ski FM from the Nevis Range ski resort, keeping skiers up to date with conditions on Aonach Mor. This was then followed by Holiday FM during the summer. Those behind the station's trial broadcasts soon realized that Lochaber needed a permanent voice on the radio, and Nevis Community Radio Action Group formed to raise funds to establish a full-time local radio station (this group has now ceased). </p><p>Nevis Radio was awarded a local commercial radio license for Fort William and Lochaber in 1994, and started full-time year-round operation. In 2012, the station successfully applied to Ofcom for relicensing as a Community Radio station.</p><p>The station broadcasts on 96.6 MHz (Fort William), 97.0 MHz (Glencoe), 102.3 MHz (Skye &amp; Mallaig) and 102.4 MHz (Loch Leven) FM, the station also transmits live on the net to UK listeners only. In 2008, it also started to provide a 'sustaining service' for Lochbroom FM in the Ullapool area outwith that station's locally produced hours, but this arrangement was suspended after a few months (a replacement service for Lochbroom FM has been provided by Two Lochs Radio since 2012). </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.nevisradio.co.uk" class="external text">www.nevisradio.co.uk</a><pre># nevis community radio ltd (fort william)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCg"><caption class="fn org">Nevis Community Radio Ltd</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Fort_William,_Highland" title="Fort William, Highland">Fort William</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Highland_(council_area)" title="Highland (council area)">Highland</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Lochaber" title="Lochaber">Lochaber</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>96.6 MHz, 102.3 MHz, 102.4 MHz, Online</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>"Let The Music Burst Out"</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Contemporary</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Self Owned</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1992</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.nevisradio.co.uk" class="external text">www.nevisradio.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
