<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KFXY-LP --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>KFXY-LP</b> is a low-power FM radio station in Mesa, Arizona. Broadcasting on 99.5 FM, KFXY-LP is owned by San Tan Educational Media and carries a country format known as <b>99.5 The Ranch</b>. </p><p>The original construction permit specified operation on 106.7 MHz, but this was soon changed to 99.1 because of severe interference from KKMR on 106.5. The station signed on in early 2014 as <b>KUKQ-LP</b> with an alternative music format known as "KQ99.1". The KUKQ callsign was formerly used at 1060 AM (now KDUS). After a stint as <b>KOWO-LP</b> "Wow 99.1" from 2014 to 2015, the station relaunched as <b>KQCX-LP</b> in September 2015, then flipped again to alternative rock as "FX 99.1" on January 1, 2016. The call sign was changed once more on January 22, 2016, to KFXY-LP; As of July 2016, the station broadcast a classic country format with Americana and Roots programming known as Coyote Country 99.1. After some time off air, KFXY came back on air with a variety format with the name, Fuzzy 99.5. Shortly after that, KFXY re-branded as 99.5 The Ranch and during the early hours of the day, KFXY plays a classic country mixed with some classic rock and Texas Country. In the afternoon hours, KFXY airs a more modern country format from the 90's to now mixed with classic rock and Texas country. </p><p>The station went off the air November 19, 2017 after they lost their tower site. Their statement to the FCC stated, "THE EQUIPMENT HAS LOST POWER AND SITE ACCESS HAS BEEN DENIED." On June 25, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that as control of KFXY-LP had substantially changed by January 1, 2016, only six months after the station's license was granted in July 2015 (FCC regulations prohibit such changes of control within the first three years of an LPFM station's licensed operation), it had failed to comply with a condition of the license and revoked KFXY-LP's authorization. San Tan Educational Media filed a "petition for reconsideration" and their license was returned on September 4, 2019. They returned to the air January 15, 2020. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://arizonasclassiccountry.com" class="external text">arizonasclassiccountry.com</a><pre># kfxy-lp (mesa, arizona)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">KFXY-LP</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Mesa,_Arizona" title="Mesa, Arizona">Mesa</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>99.5 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>99.5 The Ranch</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Country</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>San Tan Educational Media</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2014_in_radio" title="2014 in radio">2014</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>KUKQ-LP (2014)<br>KOWO-LP (2014-2015)<br>KQCX-LP (2015-2016)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>192016</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">L1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>100 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>7 meters</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Transmitter coordinates</div></th><td><span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=KFXY-LP&amp;params=33_29_32.5_N_111_38_23.9_W_" class="external text"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">33°29′32.5″N</span> <span class="longitude">111°38′23.9″W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">33.492361°N 111.639972°W</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">33.492361; -111.639972</span></span></span></a></span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://arizonasclassiccountry.com" class="external text">arizonasclassiccountry.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
