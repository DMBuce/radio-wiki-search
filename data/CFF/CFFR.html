<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CFFR --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CFFR</b> is a Canadian AM radio station broadcasting at 660 kHz in Calgary, Alberta and began broadcasting on January 10, 1984. As of April 3, 2006, it operates in an all-news format, branded <i>660 News</i>. It is a Class B, 50,000 watt station broadcasting on the clear-channel frequency of 660 AM. CFFR's studios are located on 7th Avenue Southwest in downtown Calgary, while its transmitters are located near Okotoks. </p><p>Previously, CFFR had operated a Gold Based Adult Contemporary station entitled <i>66 CFR</i>. "CFR" initially stood for "Calgary Family Radio" (with the additional "F" in the call sign being incidental), and later for "Calgary Flames Radio", although game coverage moved to sister station CFAC upon its relaunch as all-sports. The first song they played was at 7:16 am, was "A Hard Day's Night" by the Beatles after signing on with a sound of a clock ticking, CFFR's announcements with the same early 1980's jingles as CFTR in Toronto, and various number 1 songs from 1964-1983; and it was an ode to the work they had done just to get the station up and running. <i>66 CFR</i> during its early years played various hits from the late 1950's to the 1980's. The last song played before the format change was "We Built This City" by Starship. The announcement of 66 CFR leaving the air was accompanied by the closing chord of the Beatles' "A Day in the Life", which had also been the first sound heard at the start of the production piece introducing the station. </p><p>At the time of the change in format, 66 CFR was capturing an insignificant share of the Calgary listening market with an average of 1% share of hours tuned.  With few exceptions, the only significant ratings source came from Flames games. In contrast, the number one station in Calgary in 2006, CKRY-FM, remained on top of the radio listeners heap with a 13.2% share of hours tuned. </p><p>Notwithstanding a number of loyal "oldies" listeners, the change in format was inevitable. The subsequent re-branding is similar to that used by Rogers all-news or news-talk stations in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and at least four other cities. </p><p>CFFR was ranked #14 in the Fall 2011 PPM Data report released by BBM Canada.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://player.660news.com" class="external text">Listen Live</a><pre># cffr (calgary, alberta)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CFFR</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:660_News_Calgary_logo.png"><img resource="./File:660_News_Calgary_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/660_News_Calgary_logo.png/250px-660_News_Calgary_logo.png" data-file-width="316" data-file-height="316" data-file-type="bitmap" height="250" width="250" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/660_News_Calgary_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/660_News_Calgary_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Calgary" title="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Calgary_Metropolitan_Region" title="Calgary Metropolitan Region">Calgary</a> and <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Edmonton_Metropolitan_Region" title="Edmonton Metropolitan Region">Edmonton Metropolitan Regions</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>660 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Hertz" title="Hertz">kHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_radio" title="AM radio" class="mw-redirect">AM</a>)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>660 News</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Calgary's All-News Radio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./All-news_radio" title="All-news radio">News</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Talk_radio" title="Talk radio">Talk</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Rogers_Media" title="Rogers Media" class="mw-redirect"> Rogers Sports &amp; Media</a> <br>(Rogers Media, Inc.)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CFAC" title="CFAC">CFAC</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CHFM-FM" title="CHFM-FM">CHFM-FM</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CJAQ-FM" title="CJAQ-FM">CJAQ-FM</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CJCO-DT" title="CJCO-DT">CJCO-DT</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./CKAL-DT" title="CKAL-DT">CKAL-DT</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>January 10, 1984</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>C</b>algary's <b>F</b>inest <b>F</b>amily <b>R</b>adio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>50,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://player.660news.com" class="external text">Listen Live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.660citynews.com" class="external text">660citynews.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
