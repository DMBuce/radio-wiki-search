<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WEVD --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WEVD</b> was an American brokered programming radio station with some news-talk launched in August 1927 by the Socialist Party of America. Making use of the initials of recently deceased party leader Eugene Victor Debs in its call sign, the station operated from Woodhaven in the New York City borough of Queens. The station was purchased with a $250,000 radio fund raised by the Socialist Party in its largest fundraising effort of the 1920s and was intended as spreading progressive ideas to a mass audience. A number of national trade unions and other institutions aided the Socialists in obtaining the station. </p><p>Originally broadcasting at 1220 kHz AM, later on 1300 kHz, for many years on 1330 kHz and finally on 1050 kHz, operation of the station was taken over by the publishing association responsible for producing the Yiddish-language social democratic daily newspaper <i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i> in 1932. An FM station using the same call sign was added during the 1950s. After briefly leaving AM broadcasting in 1979, <i>The Forward</i> swapped its FM frequency for another AM frequency and continued broadcasting as a small ethnic station until divesting itself late in the 1980s. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=WEVD">Google Search</a><pre># wevd (unknown location)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwBg"><caption class="fn org">WEVD</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1050 kHz</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>August 18, 1927</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WSOM (1926–1927)<sup about="#mwt6" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-hc_1-0" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{"name":"hc","group":""},"body":{"html":""}}'><a href="./WEVD#cite_note-hc-1" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 1;" id="mwBw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwCA">[1]</span></a></sup></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former frequencies</div></th><td><div class="plainlist"><ul><li>1220 kHz (1927–1928)</li><li>1300 kHz (1928–1941)</li><li>1330 kHz (1941–1981, sold)</li></ul></div></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
