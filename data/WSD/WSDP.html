<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WSDP --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WSDP</b> is the student-operated radio station owned by the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park in Canton, Michigan.  The station positions itself as <b>88.1 The Park</b>.  WSDP is operated out of Salem High School and has been in operation since February 14, 1972.  The station's current manager is Bill Keith (1991â€“present). </p><p>On December 31, 2011, at noon, after stunting for several days with songs or song lyrics with the word "change" in them, such as Sheryl Crow's <i>A Change Would Do You Good</i> and The Georgia Satellites' <i>Keep Your Hands to Yourself</i> (which opens with the lyric <i>"I got a little change in my pocket, going jing-a-ling-a-ling"</i>) with announcers promoting that "change is good" and to listen at the promised time, WSDP switched its format from alternative rock as <b>88.1 The Escape</b> to Adult Contemporary as "The New 88.1, Plymouth and Canton's Hit Music," with a playlist of pop and rock hits spanning the 1970s through today. The station also announced a contest to name the new station, in which the winner would receive a $100 gas card. The name eventually became "88.1 The Park". The first song on The New 88.1 was <i>I Gotta Feeling</i> by The Black Eyed Peas. </p><p>The former "88.1 The Escape" specialized in playing independent alternative rock artists not played on any mainstream commercial station in the area.  Special programs heard on WSDP showcased classic rock, electronica, jazz, blues, contemporary Christian and other musical genres.  One highlight of the WSDP schedule was "Static Age", a punk/psychobilly show that featured local bands from the Ann Arbor/Detroit, MI Area. </p><p>In 2014, 88.1 The Park was honored by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters Foundation and took home the High School Station of the Year award. It has also since 2014 up until present day, been nominated for a Marconi award for Non-Commercial Station of the Year by the NAB. </p><p>The station continues to serve the Plymouth-Canton area with local news and information and high school sports broadcasts. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://881thepark.com/" class="external text">http://881thepark.com/</a><pre># wsdp (plymouth, michigan)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WSDP</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Plymouth,_Michigan" title="Plymouth, Michigan">Plymouth, Michigan</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>88.1 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>88.1 The Park</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Plymouth and Canton's Hit Music</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_Contemporary" title="Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Adult Contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Plymouth-Canton Schools</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>February 14, 1972</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>S</b>chool <b>D</b>istrict of <b>P</b>lymouth</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>200 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://881thepark.com/" class="external text">http://881thepark.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
