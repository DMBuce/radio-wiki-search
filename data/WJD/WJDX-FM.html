<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WJDX-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WJDX-FM</b> (105.1 FM) is an Urban contemporary station licensed to Kosciusko, Mississippi, but located in Jackson, Mississippi. It is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications until September 2014). From October 1998 to March 2003 WQJQ was a Jammin' Oldies station.  Its studios are located in northwest Jackson, and its transmitter site is east of Canton. </p><p>On January 24, 2011, WQJQ relaunched as "Oldies 105.1" and in the process changed its call letters to <b>WJDX-FM</b>. The original WJDX-FM call letters were on a progressive rock station at 102.9 (now WMSI-FM) from the late 1960s through the early 1970s. The station changed its calls to WZZQ in 1973 and would evolve from progressive rock to a locally produced AOR music format. </p><p>WJDX-FM's oldies format includes some of the songs that were popular on WJDX (AM) when that station played Top 40 music during the 1970s. </p><p>In November 2013, WJDX-FM flipped to its usual Christmas music format for the holidays. However, it changed its name to "FM 105.1: The Christmas Station," possibly meaning a change coming after the holidays. On December 26, 2013 WJDX-FM rebranded as "105.1 The River" and became a classic hits station (playing the hits of the '60s, '70s and '80s). </p><p>On September 1, 2014, the station ditched '60s music to fully concentrate on '70s and especially '80s music.  The station even had a slogan indicative of the change: "Jackson's Greatest Hits of the '70s and '80s." </p><p>On February 11, 2019, the station made the switch from classic hits to adult hits (which meant even more '80s music).  Since then, the station's slogan has been "Jackson's Greatest Hits of the '80s and More." </p><p>On May 22, 2020, at Noon, after stunting with music from different genres, WJDX flipped to urban, branding itself as “Real 105.1”.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.iheart.com/live/real-1051-1249/" class="external text">Listen Live</a><pre># wjdx-fm (kosciusko, mississippi)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WJDX-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kosciusko,_Mississippi" title="Kosciusko, Mississippi">Kosciusko, Mississippi</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Jackson,_Mississippi" title="Jackson, Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>105.1 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td><i>Real 105.1</i></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Jackson's Number one for Hip-Hop and R&amp;B!</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Urban_Contemporary" title="Urban Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Urban Contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./IHeartMedia,_Inc." title="IHeartMedia, Inc." class="mw-redirect">iHeartMedia, Inc.</a> <br>(Capstar TX LLC)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./WJDX_(AM)" title="WJDX (AM)">WJDX</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>June 25, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1965_in_radio" title="1965 in radio">1965</a> (as WKOZ-FM)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WKOZ-FM (1965–1984)<br>WBKJ (1984–1998)<br>WQJQ (1998–2011)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>6482</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">C1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>100,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>299 meters</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.iheart.com/live/real-1051-1249/" class="external text">Listen Live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://real1051.iheart.com/" class="external text">real1051.iheart.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
