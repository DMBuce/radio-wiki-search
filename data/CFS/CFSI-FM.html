However, after several non-compliances in a CRTC Audit, as well as alleged missing voluntary audits, including faulty program logs, as well as missing annual returns and several years of unpaid fees, a number of former CFSI staff/volunteers intervened  with the CRTC asking for license revocation due to the poor management of Satnam Media. After a hearing in May 2015, the CRTC revoked CFSI's radio license on June 25, 2015 and CFSI went off the air on July 25, 2015.</p><p>On November 28, 2019, Gulf Islands Community Radio Society submitted an application to operate a new community FM radio station at Salt Spring Island.
