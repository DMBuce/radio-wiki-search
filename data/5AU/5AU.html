<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/5AU --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>5AU</b> (1242 AM) is a South Australian radio station broadcasting a classic hits format from its transmitter site at Mambray Creek into the Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Kadina, Moonta and Wallaroo area and north into the Flinders Ranges. </p><p>Originally studios in Whyalla moving to Port Augusta in the Late 1970s. (Actually started in PA, then moved to Whyalla, then back to PA) Part of the 5KA network sister station 5RM Riverland and church-run 5KA Adelaide </p><p>Early-1980s announcer line up; Mark Watson on breakfast, Mark Elliston mornings, Peter Morris Afternoons and Leighton Marshall and Colin Jones Nights. </p><p>Mid-1980s line up included Gary Oborn (Breakfast) Craig Bruce (Mornings) who left the station by 1985 and went to EON FM Melbourne, Paul Wise (afternoons) and Noel McMahon (evenings). With Bruce departing, Rob McCasker joined the on air line up as afternoon announcer. </p><p>Program Manager Colin Jones left the station in 1986 and there was a management reshuffle, with McMahon and McCasker taking on the Program and Music Director roles as well as being on air. In 1986, the on air line up finally settled with Oborn (breakfast) McCasker (mornings), McMahon (afternoon) and new recruit Jim Glennon (evenings) </p><p>Noel McMahon left for EON FM Melbourne in December 1986. Rob McCasker would later join both Bruce and McMahon in Melbourne, but on the rival station FOX FM. Three announcers from the one small country station, going to a major capital city market was a major coup for the station's profile. Later Glennon would also make his way into a capital city market. </p><p>Others on air during the 1980s included Rohan Chabaud, Paul Wise, Dave Richardson, Don Plenty. </p><p>Late-1980s line up; Gary Oborn (Gonzo and eagle beak with Colin Jones) breakfast, Colin Jones mornings, Rob McCasker afternoons. </p><p>Station Manager Mark Taylor Sales Manager Gary Kernahan Program Directors Rob McCasker and Dave Richardson </p><p>On air line up as of June 2020: Classic Hits Breakfast (6-9am), Leon Byner (9-12 Noon), Afternoons (12pm-4pm) and Shovel And Bull (4pm-6pm). </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://5au.com" class="external text">5au<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span><pre># 5au (port augusta, south australia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">5AU</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Port_Augusta" title="Port Augusta">Port Augusta</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Whyalla" title="Whyalla">Whyalla</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Port_Augusta" title="Port Augusta">Port Augusta</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Port_Pirie" title="Port Pirie">Port Pirie</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1242 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kilohertz" title="Kilohertz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Classic_hits" title="Classic hits">Classic hits</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Grant_Broadcasters" title="Grant Broadcasters">Grant Broadcasters</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./5RM" title="5RM">5RM</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://5au.com" class="external text">5au<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
