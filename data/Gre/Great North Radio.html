<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Great_North_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Great North Radio</b>, or <b>G.N.R</b> as it was sometimes called, launched in March 1989 using the AM frequencies of Metro Radio and Radio Tees [1]. This happened after the Metro Radio group decided to split the FM and AM frequencies. The station was broadcast on both frequencies rather than as two separate stations. </p><p>GNR's output consisted of mellow music from the 1950s through to the 1980s, including current hits that fitted the format. There were also specialist programmes each evening, including Country Music, Jazz, and Classical. </p><p>GNR was replaced in February 1997 by Magic 1152 and Magic 1170 and was rebranded again in January 2015 when the stations became part of the Greatest Hits Radio network and are known on air as Greatest Hits North East and Greatest Hits Teesside. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Great North Radio">Google Search</a><pre># great north radio (north east england)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Great North Radio</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">North East England</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1152 &amp; 1170 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KHz" title="KHz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a>,</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Oldies</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Metro_Radio_Group" title="Metro Radio Group" class="mw-redirect">Metro Radio Group</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
