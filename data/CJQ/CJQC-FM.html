<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CJQC-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CJQC-FM</b>, branded as <b>Queens County Community Radio</b> is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts at 99.3 FM in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. </p><p>The station was officially launched on June 19, 2008 under a temporary special events licence. Its business plan was to operate throughout the summer of 2008 in order to gauge community support for the station and complete its formal application for a permanent licence. </p><p>On September 15, 2009, the station received CRTC approval for a full-time licence to operate at 99.3 MHz. The general manager at that time was the Canadian broadcaster Alex J. Walling. </p><p>In March 2011, Walling suffered a stroke, which led to the deterioration of the station's operations and the verge of bankruptcy. In June 2012, Walling sold the assets of the station to the CJQC Radio Society, a non-profit community organization.  In November 2012, the CJQC Radio Society applied for a new licence, for a station which operates at the same frequency of 99.3Â MHz at the same parameters as the old licence. CRTC licensing was approved. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CJQC-FM">Google Search</a><pre># cjqc-fm (liverpool, nova scotia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CJQC-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Liverpool,_Nova_Scotia" title="Liverpool, Nova Scotia">Liverpool</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>99.3 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_radio" title="FM radio" class="mw-redirect">FM</a>)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Queens County Community Radio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Community_radio" title="Community radio">Community radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>CJQC Radio Society</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">LP</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>50 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>-4.2 meters</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
