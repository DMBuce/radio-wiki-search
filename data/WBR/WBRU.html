<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WBRU --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WBRU</b> is an internet radio station based in Providence, Rhode Island. The station is owned and operated by Brown Broadcasting Service, an independent non-profit organization, and is primarily staffed by students from Brown University.</p><p>Formerly an FM modern rock radio station that broadcast at 95.5 FM in the Rhode Island area, WBRU currently broadcasts two online stations with different genres on each: indie and alternative on WBRU and an urban contemporary format on WBRU360, named after its long-time Sunday program, <i>The 360° Experience in Sound</i>. Since January 2018, WBRU's urban contemporary programming has been rebroadcast on Providence low-power FM station 101.1 FM, which is owned by another Brown University-affiliated group and has the call sign WBRU-LP.</p><p>WBRU has its origins in The Brown Network, which was founded in 1936 as one of the earliest amateur college radio broadcasters. By the time that the Brown Broadcasting Service organization was founded in 1962, radio broadcasting on the Brown University campus had turned from a hobbyist activity to a more serious enterprise. The organization purchased a commercial FM license in 1965 and aired its first broadcast on WBRU-FM on February 21, 1966. The station aired with a progressive rock format in the 1960s and 1970s, added new wave music into its playlist in the early 1980s, and switched to its current modern rock format in 1988. From 1966 to 2017, WBRU aired on the 95.5 FM frequency in the Providence market. In August 2017, Brown Broadcasting Service sold the 95.5 license to Educational Media Foundation and WBRU was replaced on that frequency by WLVO, a Christian adult contemporary station, at midnight on September 1, 2017. Although its primary alternative rock programming is no longer available on an over-the-air radio station, WBRU itself continues to be operated by BBS, and offers both its alternative rock and urban contemporary programming as an online-only programming provider.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.wbru.com/" class="external text">WBRU/WBRU360 radio players</a><pre># wbru/wbru360 (providence, rhode island)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WBRU/WBRU360</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Providence,_Rhode_Island" title="Providence, Rhode Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Providence,_Rhode_Island" title="Providence, Rhode Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>WBRU: the best of indie and alternative<br>WBRU360: The 360° Experience in Sound</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">WBRU: <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Modern_rock" title="Modern rock">Modern rock</a><br>WBRU360: <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Urban_contemporary" title="Urban contemporary">Urban contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Brown Broadcasting Service, Inc.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1936_in_radio" title="1936 in radio">1936</a> <small>(as The Brown Network)</small><br>February 21, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1966_in_radio" title="1966 in radio">1966</a> <small>(as an over-the-air station)</small><br>September 1, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2017_in_radio" title="2017 in radio">2017</a> <small>(as internet-only station)</small><br>January 7, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2018_in_radio" title="2018 in radio">2018</a> <small>(on 101.1 LPFM)</small></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>August 31, 2017 <small>(on 95.5 FM)</small></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>BR</b>own <b>U</b>niversity</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.wbru.com/" class="external text">WBRU/WBRU360 radio players</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://wbru.com/" class="external text">wbru.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
