<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Bailrigg_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Bailrigg FM</b> (formerly known as <b>University Radio Bailrigg (URB)</b> and <b>Radio Bailrigg</b>) is a student radio station at Lancaster University. It operates in a music format predominantly featuring pop, but also broadcasts news, drama, comedy, and entertainment. During evening and weekend hours, programming moves to specialist content where presenters are free (within reason) to play whatever they wish. </p><p>Bailrigg is one of the oldest student radio stations in the country, as well as being the first student station to broadcast on FM. It airs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round. Bailrigg first broadcast on FM as part of a one-month, 25W Restricted Services Licence in March 1994 under the directorship of Paul Dale. It had previously applied for a licence in September 1993 but was turned down by the Radio Authority due to the launch of The Bay in March of that year.</p><p>It originally broadcast to the university on 312m Medium Wave using an inductive loop aerial system around the various halls of residence. Now listeners can tune in on campus on 87.7Â MHz, or listen anywhere in the world using the station's live webstream. Bailrigg holds several large events throughout the year, including a seven-day Freshers' Week outside broadcast and coverage of the Lancaster University Students' Union (LUSU) sabbatical elections. During the Roses Tournament the station joins with University Radio York (URY) to provide programming across both campuses. </p><p>The station has received several national Student Radio Awards over the years, including Best Website, Best Station Sound and more recently Best Technical Achievement.</p><p>It was announced in April 2019 that LUSU would stop funding the license required to broadcast FM frequencies, and as such the station would only be available online from August onwards. After protest over the decision however, funding was given in August for the license to be renewed. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.la1tv.co.uk/livestream/9" class="external text">Live Stream</a><pre># bailrigg fm (bailrigg, lancaster, united kingdom)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt3" id="mwBg"><caption class="fn org">Bailrigg FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png"><img resource="./File:Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png/220px-Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png" data-file-width="3016" data-file-height="601" data-file-type="bitmap" height="44" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png/330px-Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png/440px-Bailrigg_87.7_FM_Logo_2020.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td>Bailrigg, Lancaster, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>24/7 on <span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">87.7</span> <span class="unit">FM</span></span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>The Original Student Sound</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Student_Radio" title="Student Radio" class="mw-redirect">Student Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><div class="plainlist"><ul><li><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Student_Radio_Association" title="Student Radio Association">Student Radio Association</a></li><li><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Lancaster_University" title="Lancaster University">Lancaster University</a></li></ul></div></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Lancaster_University_Students'_Union" title="Lancaster University Students' Union">Lancaster University Students' Union</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./LA1:TV" title="LA1:TV" class="mw-redirect">LA1:TV</a> (Television)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.la1tv.co.uk/livestream/9" class="external text">Live Stream</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://bailriggradio.lancastersu.co.uk/" class="external text">https://bailriggradio.lancastersu.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
