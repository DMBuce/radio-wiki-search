A number of unusual events and precedents throughout the station's history make its story of unusual interest.  These events include (but are not limited to): </p> <ul><li>In lieu of a "C" class licence, the granting of a "B" class licence in 1931, but with limiting conditions including: a position on the dial that could not be picked up by most contemporary radio sets; only allowed to broadcast when other Melbourne commercial stations were off the air, that is, most of the time only at night; limited power.</li> <li>The founder of the station was George F. Palmer, the father of Clive Palmer.</li> <li>The sharing of its wavelength with 2BS Bathurst, a station that was comparatively close geographically, thus causing interference problems.</li> <li>From 1954, permitted to broadcast during daylight hours, but only when its signal was perceived not to interfere with that of 2BS.</li> <li>Purchased in 1961 by Australian Consolidated Press and thus became sister station of GTV-9. Most high-profile GTV personalities also broadcast on 3AK.</li> <li>When some FM licences were auctioned off to existing AM stations in 1989, 3AK became one of the two successful Melbourne bidders, but the station did not take up the offer because of ownership changes.</li> <li>In 1990, purchased by Peter Corso.  3AK thus became an Italian language station for some years.</li> <li>In late 2003 the 3AK license was leased to Sports Entertainment Network and from January 2004 it became a 24-hour sports station, using the on-air name SEN whilst having to retain 3AK as its official callsign.</li></ul><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=3AK">Google Search</a><pre># 3ak (melbourne, victoria)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">3AK</caption><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;font-size:100%; background-color: #bfdfff;">Licence of <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1116_SEN" title="1116 SEN">1116 SEN</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Victoria_(Australia)" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">Melbourne RA1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><div class="plainlist"><ul><li><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a>: <span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">1116</span> <span class="unit">kHz</span></span></li><li><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./DAB+" title="DAB+" class="mw-redirect">DAB+</a>: 9A Melbourne</li></ul></div></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Language(s)</th><td class="category">English</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>29<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>November<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>1931<span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>(<span class="bday dtstart published updated">1931-11-29</span>)</span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>18<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>January<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>2004<span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>(<span class="dtend">2004-01-18</span>)</span> (as 3AK)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former frequencies</div></th><td><div class="plainlist"><ul><li>AM: <span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">1500</span> <span class="unit">kHz</span></span> (1931–1978)</li></ul></div><span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">1503</span> <span class="unit">kHz</span></span> (1978–2001)</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
