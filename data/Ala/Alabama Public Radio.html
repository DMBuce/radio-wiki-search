<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Alabama_Public_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p><b>Alabama Public Radio</b> (<b>APR</b>) is a network of public radio stations based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States, that serves roughly the western half of the state of Alabama with classical music, folk music, jazz, and nostalgic music programs, as well as news and feature programs from the National Public Radio (NPR), Public Radio International (PRI), and American Public Media (APM) networks. The network is operated by the University of Alabama, with studios in Tuscaloosa. </p><p>Since the station is licensed to a university, students in the UA College of Communication and Information Sciences get opportunities for practical training in announcing and other varied production duties. Nonetheless, APR maintains a small professional staff, as well as several volunteer announcers from the larger community.  The Alabama Public Radio newsroom has recently won over 50 awards for journalism excellence, one third of which are at the national and international levels. This includes RTDNA's national Edward R. Murrow award for Overall Excellence. The APR news team also works extensively with journalism students at the University of Alabama. Newsroom student interns typically put in 750 hours of work, which results in 142 minutes of Alabama-centric news, which airs statewide. This provides students with valuable real-life experience, and material for their resumes. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.apr.org" class="external text">apr.org</a><pre># wual-fm (tuscaloosa, alabama)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">WUAL-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Tuscaloosa,_Alabama" title="Tuscaloosa, Alabama">Tuscaloosa, Alabama</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td><i>Alabama Public Radio</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Public_Radio" title="Public Radio" class="mw-redirect">Public Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./American_Public_Media" title="American Public Media">American Public Media</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./National_Public_Radio" title="National Public Radio" class="mw-redirect">National Public Radio</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Public_Radio_International" title="Public Radio International">Public Radio International</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Repeater" title="Repeater">Repeater(s)</a></th><td>WUAL-FM 91.5 (Tuscaloosa)<br>WQPR 88.7 (Muscle Shoals)<br>WAPR 88.3 (Selma)<br> WHIL 91.3 (Mobile)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.apr.org" class="external text">apr.org</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
