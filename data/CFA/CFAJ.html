<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CFAJ --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p><b>CFAJ</b> is a AM radio station located in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. CFAJ broadcast both daytime and nighttime with a radiated power of 10,000 watts at 1220Â kHz AM. The signal pushed mainly north and west, but is on a reduced pattern in both easterly and southerly directions due to interference with a co-channel station in Cleveland (WHKW) and with AM 1230 WECK (Cheektowaga), forty miles to the east.  CFAJ can routinely be heard as far north as parts of cottage country and west beyond Guelph. </p><p>CHSC aired a mix of adult contemporary, oldies along with a bit of country typically attracting audiences ages 30 and up, both male and female.   CHSC played a mix of 50 per cent gold and 50 per cent current/recurrent of which 45 per cent on average consisted of Canadian content during the broadcast week of Sunday to Saturday. </p><p>Listeners could also find interviews in both the English and Italian. The station's regular English programming was branded as <b>1220 CHSC</b>, and its Italian programming was branded as <b>Radio Uno</b>. </p><p>On July 30, 2010, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied the station's application for renewal. As of 2011, the station now broadcasts a full-time Italian language format via Internet streaming and marketed toward the Greater Toronto Area, but has not been licensed to relaunch on the AM band. As of 2020, the internet streaming is no longer functional. </p><p>As of 2020, the station is back on air broadcasting a Classic Hits format under the new CFAJ callsign. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CFAJ">Google Search</a><pre># cfaj (st. catharines, ontario)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">CFAJ</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./St._Catharines" title="St. Catharines">St. Catharines</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Niagara_Regional_Municipality" title="Niagara Regional Municipality" class="mw-redirect">Niagara Region</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Greater_Toronto_Area" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1220 kHz</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>The Voice, 1220 CFAJ</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Classic_hits" title="Classic hits">Classic hits</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Radio Dhun</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1967 (as CHSC)<br>2020 (as CFAJ)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>October 2, 2010 (as CHSC)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>CHSC (1967-2010)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>10,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> day and night</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
