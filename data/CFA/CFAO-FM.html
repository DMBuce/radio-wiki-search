<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CFAO-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CFAO-FM</b> was a radio station that operated at 94.7 FM in Alliston, Ontario, Canada. The station broadcast an adult contemporary music format. </p><p>Owned by Frank Rogers, on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated the station was licensed on July 28, 2008.</p><p>In 2008, Rogers was licensed to operate a second radio station at Beeton with the callsign CJBT-FM. Not yet on the air, that station had until August 1, 2012 to launch, or face the cancellation of the license.</p><p>In 2009, CFAO-FM began on-air testing. It is uncertain when the station officially launched. </p><p>As of June 25, 2010, CFAO-FM has been shut down due to economic troubles, which led to the station's eviction from its rented studios; also during these final days of operation, the station was unable to pay wages to its staffers.</p><p>In 2013, Rogers sought renewal of CFAO-FM's license; however, on December 19, 2014, the CRTC denied the station's renewal, citing many violations, including remaining dark since 2011, and failing to meet numerous target dates to resume broadcasting - the most recent being April 1, 2014. An intervention report from My Broadcasting Corporation, owner of competing station CIMA-FM, cited that CFAO was only on the air for 11 months at most.</p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CFAO-FM">Google Search</a><pre># cfao-fm (alliston, ontario)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CFAO-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Alliston,_Ontario" title="Alliston, Ontario" class="mw-redirect">Alliston, Ontario</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>94.7 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_radio" title="FM radio" class="mw-redirect">FM</a>)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_contemporary" title="Adult contemporary" class="mw-redirect">adult contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Frank Rogers <br>(2188301 Ontario Corporation)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2009 (testing)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>2010</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>C</b> <b>F</b> <b>A</b>lliston, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ontario" title="Ontario"><b>O</b>ntario</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
