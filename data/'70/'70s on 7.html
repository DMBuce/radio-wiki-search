<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/'70s_on_7 --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p>'<b>70s on 7</b> (or just <b>The '70s</b>) is a commercial-free, satellite radio channel on the Sirius XM Radio channel 7 and Dish Network 6007. It plays pop, rock, soul and disco music from the 1970s, mostly hits. Prior to XMâ€™s merger with Sirius, Arbitron reported that '70s on 7 was the fourth most listened to channel, with a cume of 667,400 listeners per week. As part of the Sirius/XM merger on November 12, 2008, The '70s was merged with Sirius' Totally '70s and took its current name. </p><p>Much like the other decades channels, '70s on 7 attempts to recreate the feel of 1970s radio. It uses similar DJ techniques, jingles, 1970s slang, and news updates. Kid Kelly formerly, of WHTZ New York, programs the channel with Human Numan, a long time contemporary hit radio personality. Creative imaging is produced by producer Mitch Todd who oversees all producers and production on the music channels and the marketing division. Due to being commercial-free, it does not recreate any sponsor spots. The channel was also used for XM's annual pop music chronology, <b>IT</b>. </p><p>The original XM "70s on 7" channel made a strong effort to reproduce the smooth, velvety 1970s FM sound rather than the chatty "morning drive" sound that Sirius favored.  After the XM-Sirius merger the "morning drive" sound became the "official" sound of the 1970s channel. The channel features the unique "Jukebox of Dynamite" (formerly the "Jukebox of Cheese"), when an alleged listener selects a "cheesy" song for the segment such as "Seasons in the Sun", "Theme from Billy Jack", "Run Joey Run" or "Billy Don't Be A Hero". </p><p>70s on 7 also uses bumpers that parody TV shows and commercial jingles from the 70s, and also has its own parodies of movie scenes, known as "director's cuts". </p><p>The station's logo currently has a flower as the zero. Prior to 2015, the station's logo featured a disco ball as the zero. The internet version can be biased to play only disco and soul. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.siriusxm.com/70son7" class="external text">SiriusXM: '70s on 7</a><pre># '70s on 7 (united statescanada)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">'70s on 7</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png"><img resource="./File:The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png/220px-The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png" data-file-width="360" data-file-height="170" data-file-type="bitmap" height="104" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png/330px-The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/The_current_logo_of_70s_on_7.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./United_States" title="United States">United States</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sirius_XM_Radio" title="Sirius XM Radio" class="mw-redirect">Sirius XM Radio</a> 7<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Dish_Network" title="Dish Network">Dish Network</a> 6007</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Totally Super '70s Sounds!</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">1970s' Music</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sirius_XM_Radio" title="Sirius XM Radio" class="mw-redirect">Sirius XM Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>September 25, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2001_in_radio" title="2001 in radio">2001</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Satellite_Radio" title="Satellite Radio" class="mw-redirect">Satellite Radio</a> Station</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.siriusxm.com/70son7" class="external text">SiriusXM: '70s on 7</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
