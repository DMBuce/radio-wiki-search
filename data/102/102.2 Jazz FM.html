<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/102.2_Jazz_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p><b>102.2 Jazz FM</b> (also known as <b>London Jazz Radio</b> and <b>JFM</b>) was a local jazz and soul music station for London run by GMG Radio. The station was based in and broadcast from Castlereagh Street in London. The station experimented with its core playlist over its fifteen-year history, incorporating smooth jazz, mainstream jazz, soul, jazz fusion, acid jazz, blues and rhythm and blues. In 1994 the station changed its name to JFM to encourage more listeners who were put off by the 'Jazz' in the station's name. Richard Wheatly was appointed in 1995 to turn the station around when there was only three months' money left to run the station. Wheatly made a number of sweeping changes to the playlist, selling a sister station and changing the name back to Jazz FM, as well as starting up a record label and spin-off business deals and opportunities which helped Jazz FM swing into the black and make a profit in 2001.</p><p>In July 2002, after a relaxation in ownership rules from the publication of the Communications Bill, the Guardian Media Group's radio division was able to purchase the station for Â£44.5 million. GMG made more changes to the playlist, shifting to more R&amp;B, soul, easy listening and adult contemporary music during the daytime. In 2004 with the agreement of Ofcom, jazz was dropped from the daytime schedules but retained a requirement of 45 hours of jazz to be played during the night. </p><p>In June 2005, GMG Radio replaced the station with adult contemporary station 102.2 Smooth FM. GMG cited a number of reasons for replacing Jazz FM, including poor listening figures, not making money, the 'Jazz' name putting off potential listeners as well as not enough jazz for jazz purists. The Jazz FM name was retained by GMG for the relaunched ejazz.fm website service which was renamed jazzfm.com on the same day as the launch of Smooth FM. The station broadcast on digital satellite, online and on spare DAB capacity in Yorkshire, South Wales and the Severn Estuary where 102.2 Smooth FM and the defunct Smooth Digital service would have been duplicated. </p><p>On 28 February 2008 GMG Radio announced the potential return of Jazz FM in London on DAB radio, digital satellite and the Internet as a relaunch of the current jazzfm.com service. The station relaunched on 6 October 2008.</p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://jazzfm.com" class="external text">jazzfm<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span><pre># 102.2 jazz fm  (greater london (fm),nationwide (freeview)nationwide (sky digital)greater london, yorkshire, south wales and the severn estuary, west midlands, north east england, central scotland (dab))</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCQ"><caption class="fn org">102.2 Jazz FM <i>(defunct)</i></caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:Jazzfm_old1.png"><img resource="./File:Jazzfm_old1.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/Jazzfm_old1.png/100px-Jazzfm_old1.png" data-file-width="113" data-file-height="35" data-file-type="bitmap" height="31" width="100" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Jazzfm_old1.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Jazzfm_old1.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Greater_London" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> (FM),<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Nationwide</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Freeview_(UK)" title="Freeview (UK)">Freeview</a>)<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Nationwide</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sky_(UK_and_Ireland)" title="Sky (UK and Ireland)" class="mw-redirect">Sky Digital</a>)<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Greater_London" title="Greater London">Greater London</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./South_Wales" title="South Wales">South Wales</a> and the <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bristol_Channel" title="Bristol Channel">Severn Estuary</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./West_Midlands_(region)" title="West Midlands (region)">West Midlands</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./North_East_England" title="North East England">North East England</a>, Central Scotland (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Digital_audio_broadcasting" title="Digital audio broadcasting" class="mw-redirect">DAB</a>)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>102.2 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Get it on</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Jazz" title="Jazz">Jazz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./GMG_Radio" title="GMG Radio">GMG Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>4 March <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1990_in_radio" title="1990 in radio">1990</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://jazzfm.com" class="external text">jazzfm<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
