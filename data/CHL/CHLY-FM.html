<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CHLY-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CHLY 101.7 FM</b> is a campus radio station based in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. Primarily funded by students of Vancouver Island University's Nanaimo campus, the station is also supported by donations and memberships from the community, as well as sponsorship and advertising from local businesses.</p><p>CHLY is run by the Radio Malaspina Society, an incorporated society with a constitution and mission to broadcast an FM radio signal of 3,000 watts to a community of service which includes Nanaimo, Lantzville, Ladysmith and Gabriola Island. The station had its beginnings on the Internet on April 1, 2000, before gaining its broadcasting licence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on June 5. CHLY aired a test signal at 101.7 FM on September 21, and ran promotional material about the station for two weeks before officially signing on at 6:00Â p.m. on October 5, 2001.</p><p>CHLY's studio is located in the basement of the Queens Hotel on Victoria Crescent in downtown Nanaimo. The station features an eclectic format with a variety of music genres (including jazz, reggae, alternative rock, hip-hop, roots music, folk and electronica) and programs reporting on issues of the campus, local community and the world. The longest-running program to air on CHLY is the <i>Elevator Club</i>, a program of easy listening music hosted by Gord Bibby since the station's inception; its original run on CHLY aired on Sunday nights from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. until its final program on the station aired on September 28, 2014. After ending its long run on CHLY, <i>Elevator Club</i> then began broadcasting exclusively on Saltspring Island radio station CFSI-FM, which was the show's most recent host station before CFSI went off the air under CRTC orders on July 25, 2015, after which the show began broadcasting exclusively via podcast.  <i>Elevator Club</i> returned to CHLY on October 16, 2017, now airing from 11 p.m. Sundays to 1 a.m. Mondays.</p><p>CHLY is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.chly.ca/" class="external text">CHLY 101.7FM</a><pre># chly 101.7fm (nanaimo, bc)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CHLY 101.7FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png"><img resource="./File:The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png/150px-The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png" data-file-width="316" data-file-height="316" data-file-type="bitmap" height="150" width="150" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png/225px-The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png/300px-The_logo_of_CHLY_101.7FM.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Nanaimo" title="Nanaimo">Nanaimo</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">BC</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>101.7 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_radio" title="FM radio" class="mw-redirect">FM</a>)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>CHLY 101.7 FM</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>The Voice of Nanaimo BC</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Freeform_(radio_format)#Freeform_radio_vs._eclectic_radio" title="Freeform (radio format)" class="mw-redirect">Eclectic</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Radio Malaspina Society</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>October 5, 2001</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>3,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>95 meters</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.chly.ca/" class="external text">CHLY 101.7FM</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
