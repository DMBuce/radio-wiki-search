<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Radio_Winchcombe --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Radio Winchcombe</b> is an English local community radio station which broadcasts to Winchcombe and the surrounding areas. </p><p>In December 2011 it was announced on the station's Twitter and Facebook pages that it had received a full-time licence from Ofcom, allowing it to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on FM to Winchcombe and the surrounding area. The frequency was later confirmed as 107.1<span>Â </span>FM and the launch date as Friday 18 May 2012.</p><p>From 2005 to 2011, the station broadcast twice a year under Ofcom's Restricted Service Licence regime since its first broadcast in April 2005. The first broadcast was partly inspired by the success of the now defunct Forest of Dean Radio, and was the first community service in Gloucestershire to launch after FOD Radio. Radio Winchcombe was also the first RSL station in the UK to acquire a special emergency broadcast licence from Ofcom during the Gloucestershire floods in 2007 to aid communication in the community. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiowinchcombe.co.uk" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.radiowinchcombe<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.uk</a></span><pre># radio winchcombe (winchcombe, gloucestershire, england)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">Radio Winchcombe</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Winchcombe" title="Winchcombe">Winchcombe</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Gloucestershire" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, England</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>107.1 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a> and online</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Talk, Music, Local Community interest</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>April 2005</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiowinchcombe.co.uk" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.radiowinchcombe<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.uk</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
