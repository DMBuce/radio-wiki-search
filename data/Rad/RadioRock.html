<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/RadioRock --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Radio Rock</b> is an Italian local radio station that airs from Rome, that can be listened to in most of Lazio, and streams over the internet from its website.</p><p>It is called in such a way because it mainly transmits rock music 24 hours per day. It started broadcasting in 1985, and since then it has steadily grown throughout the years. Its listeners overwhelm well-known radio stations' listeners of the Lazio Region and the capital, Rome. According to the <i>Audi report</i> on the first quarter of 2010 it reached  156,000 people daily (in average). In 1998, when three of the founders left the radio (Artico, Castaldo and Andreani), the audience averaged 101,000 for the day. </p><p>It is well known in the Italian rock scene for bringing to the <i>Roman</i> musical scene famous international musicians, previously unknown in Italy. This has been possible since Radio Rock sponsors a number of concerts and events in Rome. Thanks to this organization, Radio Rock has brought to the public attention a number of artists, such as Porcupine Tree, Elettrojoyce, the Bevis Frond, Ozric Tentacles and others. </p><p>Different disc jockeys have worked for Radio Rock since its foundation in 1985. Each dj brings a peculiar choice in musical selection but all of them deeply fond of music. Since 2004 <i>Radio Rock Italia</i>, a twin project of Italian rock music, is presented by only women dj's: Francesca, Anto [ now @ www.rockam.it ], Marta, Tosca [ now @ www.rockam.it ], Vane [ now @ www.rockam.it ]. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiorock.it/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.radiorock<wbr></wbr>.it</a></span><pre># radio rock (central-italy, lazio)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwBg"><caption class="fn org">Radio Rock</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">Central-<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Lazio" title="Lazio">Lazio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>FM 106.6 (in Rome Province)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>"RadioRock c'e' e si sente!"</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Rock_music" title="Rock music">Rock music</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1985</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiorock.it/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.radiorock<wbr></wbr>.it</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
