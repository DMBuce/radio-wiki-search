<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Radio_Adelaide --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Radio Adelaide</b> (call sign: 5UV) is Australia's first community radio station; established by Adelaide University in 1972. The signal reaches across the Adelaide metropolitan area to the Mid North, the Yorke Peninsula and Fleurieu Peninsula, the southern Barossa, Kangaroo Island, Riverland and parts of the Eyre Peninsula broadcasting at 13 kilowatts on 101.5 MHz FM. The transmitter power was only 7 kW until an upgrade on 2 November 2006. </p><p>Radio Adelaide was formerly known as 5UV, denoting its links to the University of Adelaide, the university where the radio station was originally located and started. The radio station was renamed Radio Adelaide in 2002 to coincide with its transfer from AM to FM band, following the ABA Licence Area Plans for Adelaide finding an available frequency on 101.5 FM.</p><p>Radio Adelaide is highly autonomous despite technically being owned by the University of Adelaide until 2016, when the university sold the radio station premises and transferred the broadcast licence to Educational Broadcasters Adelaide Inc (EBA). The station is run by over five hundred volunteer station workers as well as a small amount of paid staff. Because Radio Adelaide is a community radio station, there are many program styles including comedy, music, etc. Because of this, Radio Adelaide uses strip programming to ensure some consistency and coherency. Programs on Radio Adelaide are  provided by volunteers and also by access groups who pay for on air time. The largest purchaser of access time was "Student Radio" a collection of Radio Programs provided by university students from the University of Adelaide, Flinders University and the University of South Australia. After the introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism the hours which Student Radio broadcasts have been reduced, making the "Roundabout" program the largest purchaser of access time. Radio Adelaide collaborates with community radio stations 2SER Sydney and 4EB Brisbane to contribute content to the national current affairs radio programme <i>The Wire</i> by co-ordinating, resourcing and developing stories.</p><p>Radio Adelaide was a Registered Training Organisation providing nationally accredited training and in 1999 won Adult Learning Australia's Outstanding Training Provider of the Year Award. Radio Adelaide has audio production facilities available including recording, mastering, duplication, online audio, digital transfer, message on hold, equipment hire and expert technical advice. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://radioadelaide.org.au/" class="external free">https://radioadelaide.org.au/</a><pre># radio adelaide 101.5 fm (formerly 5uv) (adelaide)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCg"><caption class="fn org">Radio Adelaide 101.5 FM (formerly 5UV)</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adelaide" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adelaide" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>101.5 MHz <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_broadcast_band" title="FM broadcast band">FM</a>, DAB+</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Radio Adelaide</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Language(s)</th><td class="category">English, Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish, Polish, Farsi, Swahili, Persian, Bhutanese,</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://radioadelaide.org.au/" class="external free">https://radioadelaide.org.au/</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
