Radio Tircoed's first transmission took place from December 2006 to January 2007, and on 13 February 2007, the station was given permission by OFCOM to broadcast 24 hours a day on a permanent basis. While the permanent launch was delayed, the station broadcast more RSL sessions during July 2008. The station began full-time broadcasting on Monday 1 December 2008 at 8am on 106.5 FM - the first song played was <i>Start Me Up</i> by the Rolling Stones. </p><p>The station is run by a core staff of over 40 volunteers. Programming output varies throughout the day with various music-led, talk and feature programmes alongside specialist output in the evenings and at weekends, sports coverage and weekly programmes in the Welsh language. The majority of the station's output is locally produced and presented, although some late night programming is syndicated. </p><p>Radio Tircoed also maintains a presence within the community, in its immediate transmission area and in the wider sense, by providing audio facilities for community events such as village fetes, dog shows and concerts. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiotircoed.com/" class="external text">Radio Tircoed</a><pre># radio tircoed 106.5fm (swansea (tircoed forest village))</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">Radio Tircoed 106.5FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Swansea" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> (<i>Tircoed Forest Village</i>)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Tircoed" title="Tircoed" class="mw-redirect">Tircoed</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Penllergaer" title="Penllergaer">Penllergaer</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Pontardulais" title="Pontardulais" class="mw-redirect">Pontardulais</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Gorseinon" title="Gorseinon">Gorseinon</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Pontlliw" title="Pontlliw">Pontlliw</a> and surrounding areas</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>106.5 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a>, Online &amp; Tune In Radio App</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td><i>South Wales' Best Variety Radio Station</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Language(s)</th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./English_language" title="English language">English</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Community <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_Contemporary_Music_Station" title="Adult Contemporary Music Station" class="new">Adult Contemporary Music Station</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Tircoed Village Trust</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>14 July 2007</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.radiotircoed.com/" class="external text">Radio Tircoed</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
