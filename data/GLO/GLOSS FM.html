<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/GLOSS_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>GLOSS FM</b> is an online community radio station in the United Kingdom, broadcasting to Thornbury and District, South Gloucestershire.  Its strapline is "Your Local Station".  It originally started broadcasting to the South Gloucestershire area on 19 April 2010.  It was an extension of <b>Thornbury FM</b>, a smaller station broadcasting to just Thornbury which had started on 19 November 2005.  In November 2009, the station relocated its transmitter which increased its coverage area.  After an open competition GLOSS FM was chosen as the station's new name in order to be more relevant to all listeners.  GLOSS FM legally broadcast under the terms of Ofcom's Restricted Service Licence regime until the spring of 2011. This restricted the station to a maximum of two 28-day broadcasts per year in addition to its webcasts which were broadcast continually. In this year the station closed after an unsuccessful licence bid for a permanent FM frequency which was rejected by Ofcom due to "no suitable FM frequency available" in the area - an assertion which they have since indicated is not correct.  After a 6 year break and several attempts to restart it, the station re-launched on 29 July 2017.</p><b>URL:</b> www.glossfm.co.uk<pre># gloss fm (thornbury, gloucestershire)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">GLOSS FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:GLOSS_FM_logo.png"><img resource="./File:GLOSS_FM_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/GLOSS_FM_logo.png/220px-GLOSS_FM_logo.png" data-file-width="480" data-file-height="207" data-file-type="bitmap" height="95" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/GLOSS_FM_logo.png/330px-GLOSS_FM_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/GLOSS_FM_logo.png/440px-GLOSS_FM_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Thornbury,_Gloucestershire" title="Thornbury, Gloucestershire">Thornbury, Gloucestershire</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">Thornbury <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./South_Gloucestershire" title="South Gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a>, UK</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Your Local Station</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Music, Local Community interest</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Thornbury Media CIC</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td>www.glossfm.co.uk</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
