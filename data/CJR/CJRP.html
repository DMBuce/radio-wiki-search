<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CJRP --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><i>For the radio station in Saint John, New Brunswick, see CJRP-FM.</i> </p> <p><b>CJRP</b> was a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City, Quebec.  It operated from 1959 to 1994. </p><p>The station broadcast on 1060 kHz, using a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 10,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna with different patterns day and night to protect KYW in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </p><p>CJRP was originally known as <b>CJLR</b> and went on the air as an independent station owned by Jacques La Roche (hence the call sign) on October 24, 1959.  It originally had a power of 5,000 watts full-time and used a single directional pattern at all times.  Power was increased to 10,000 watts full-time in 1962. </p><p>In 1969, the station was bought by Raymond Crépault, who already owned CJMS in Montreal. CJLR's call sign was changed to <b>CJRP</b> (with the "RP" standing for "Radio Provinciale") and the station became a part of the Radiomutuel network. </p><p>In 1977, the station increased its daytime power to 50,000 watts, using a different directional pattern than the one now used only at night. </p><p>CJRP's Top 40 format was abandoned in favour of oldies mixing news/talk in the early 1980s. On July 29, 1982, a sister station, CHIK-FM, went on the air. </p><p>On September 30, 1994, it was announced that Telemedia and Radiomutuel would immediately merge their respective AM news/talk network into the new Radiomédia network. In each of the six markets where the two networks competed, the station which had the best signal remained on-air, and the other one was closed. As local rival CHRC had a much better signal (50,000 watts all day), CJRP had to cease its operations on that day. </p><p>The station's licence was revoked by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 2, 1994. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CJRP">Google Search</a><pre># cjrp (defunct) (quebec city, quebec)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt3" id="mwCQ"><caption class="fn org">CJRP (defunct)</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:CJRP_1060_logo.PNG"><img resource="./File:CJRP_1060_logo.PNG" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/CJRP_1060_logo.PNG/210px-CJRP_1060_logo.PNG" data-file-width="350" data-file-height="149" data-file-type="bitmap" height="89" width="210" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/CJRP_1060_logo.PNG/315px-CJRP_1060_logo.PNG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/CJRP_1060_logo.PNG 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Quebec_City" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1060 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KHz" title="KHz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a> (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a>)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Defunct (was <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Oldies" title="Oldies">oldies</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Talk_radio" title="Talk radio">news/talk</a><sup about="#mwt6" class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-1" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-1"}}'><a href="./CJRP#cite_note-1" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 1;" id="mwCg"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwCw">[1]</span></a></sup>)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Radiomutuel</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>October 24, 1959</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>CJLR (1959-1969)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>CJ R</b>adio <b>P</b>rovinciale</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>50,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> (daytime)<br>10,000 watts (nighttime)</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
