<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CJRM-FM_(Montreal) --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CJRM-FM</b> was a French-language Canadian radio station located in Montreal, Quebec.  It opened on September 30, 1965 and closed on June 24, 1968 due to financial difficulties.</p><p>The station broadcast on 98.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts using an omnidirectional antenna (class C1). It had a classical music format. </p><p>Licensed as one of the first standalone FM stations in Canada, the station's budget was so tight that it had only four employees (which was unusual at the time for a radio station), and it relied entirely on newspapers as a source for news bulletins. The station was plagued with serious technical and financial difficulties; listeners received the station with indifference. </p><p>One consequence of the failure of CJRM-FM to succeed with its classical music format was that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected for decades new applications to open a private classical music station in Montreal. When the CRTC finally gave Jean-Pierre Coallier permission to open CJPX-FM in 1997, that station would turn out to be a success. </p><p>The 98.5 MHz frequency was reactivated in the Montreal area on April 9, 1977, when CIEL-FM (now CHMP-FM) went on the air. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CJRM-FM (Montreal)">Google Search</a><pre># cjrm-fm (montreal)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CJRM-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">98.5</span> <span class="unit">MHz</span></span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Language(s)</th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./French_language" title="French language">French</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>September<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>30,<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>1965<span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>(<span class="bday dtstart published updated">1965-09-30</span>)</span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>June<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>24,<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>1968<span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>(<span class="dtend">1968-06-24</span>)</span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>100,000 watts</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
