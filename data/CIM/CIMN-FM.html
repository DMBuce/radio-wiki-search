<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CIMN-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CIMN-FM</b> was a Canadian campus radio station at the University of Prince Edward Island in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. </p><p>The station began as a "very low power broadcast station", known as Radio UPEI and operated from the top floor of the administrative building in 1970. The transmitters were home-made and of solid state design. In 1972, the UPEI Student Union funded upgrades to a carrier current system operating on 700Â kHz using the callsign CSUR. This conflicted with international callsign allocations (the ITU prefix CS is assigned to Portugal, not Canada), so a new application was made for the callsign CIMN (Campus Information Music &amp; News). </p><p>A series of transmitters, using the electrical wiring of buildings as the antenna system, were located in the various residences. A set of control rooms and production studios located on the 4th floor of Main Building remained in operation for a number of years. At that time, the station had a station manager, and a news director, paid by the Student Union.  The station also began to simulcast audio via the local cable television system into homes in the area. </p><p>In 1982, the studios were moved to the Barn, which housed student union offices and student activity areas on campus. </p><p>The station received a full FM license in 1995 to broadcast at 90.3 FM, and at this point, legal problems began. CIMN became the first Canadian station without a full-time staff person to be granted a broadcast licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). </p><p>The licence expired in August 2000 and was not renewed.</p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CIMN-FM">Google Search</a><pre># cimn-fm (charlottetown, prince edward island)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CIMN-FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Charlottetown" title="Charlottetown">Charlottetown</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Prince_Edward_Island" title="Prince Edward Island">Prince Edward Island</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Campus_radio" title="Campus radio">Campus radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>U.P.E.I.
