<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/ABC_NewsRadio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>ABC NewsRadio</b> (formerly known as <b>ABC News on Radio</b>) is an Australian Broadcasting Corporation 24-hour news radio service.  It is available on a number of broadcasts around Australia, including AM/FM radio, DAB+ radio, free to air digital TV, some pay-TV platforms and online. </p><p>Originally called the <i>Parliamentary and News Network</i> (PNN), the AM/FM radio network is chartered to broadcast live the proceedings of parliament, either the House of Representatives or the Senate, as specified by the standing orders. Also broadcast, at the end of each day's sitting, is a recording of Question Time for the chamber that was not broadcast live that day. These restrictions do not apply to the other broadcasts of NewsRadio. </p><p>Parliamentary broadcasting was commenced by Ben Chifley's government on 10 July 1946, on ABC Radio. These broadcasts received their own frequencies in the 1980s as PNN. The PNN/ABC NewsRadio service was introduced in August 1994 to use the Parliamentary broadcasting frequencies which were not being used when Parliament was not in session. </p><p>ABC NewsRadio has a 24-hour news format, including extensive finance, science and IT reports, as well as extended reports from the ABC's local and international news sources. ABC NewsRadio also rebroadcasts international programming from the BBC, DW-Radio, Radio Netherlands and <i>All Things Considered</i> from NPR. On AM and FM radio, ABC News also broadcasts Australian Football League matches on weekends in New South Wales and Queensland, where the National Rugby League is the more popular football competition and thus is broadcast on ABC Local Radio services in those two states. </p><p>ABC NewsRadio callsigns for stations on the AM radio band are always <i>xPB</i>, where <i>x</i> is the number denoting the particular state or territory and <i>PB</i> stands for <i>Parliamentary Broadcasting</i>. ABC News on Radio stations on the FM radio band use callsigns of the format <i>xPNN</i>. </p><p>ABC NewsRadio also uses resources from around the world such as news bulletins and programs from the BBC. </p><p>From September 2001, the 24-hour news format began live audio streaming on the Internet. When Parliament is in session, listeners who have Internet access may still receive the NewsRadio service even when the News on Radio network is broadcasting Parliamentary proceedings over the air. From 2004, this was extended to FTA digital satellite and subscription TV services. In 2009, separate standard and parliamentary feeds were launched on digital terrestrial (DAB+) radio in the state capitals. </p><p>FM transmission was expanded greatly during a 2006-2009 program. It planned to increase the AM/FM coverage from 78% of the population to 95%. </p><p>In November 2016, the ABC announced that ABC NewsRadio and ABC News 24 rebranded as <b>ABC News</b> on 10 April 2017.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://radio.abc.net.au/stations/news/live" class="external text">Live Stream</a><pre># abc news (australia - some areas am/fm & internet)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt9" id="mwDg"><caption class="fn org">ABC News</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> - Some Areas <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_broadcasting" title="FM broadcasting">FM</a> &amp; <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio/listen" class="external text">Internet</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>Various (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_broadcasting" title="FM broadcasting">FM</a> and <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a>; see <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./ABC_NewsRadio#Frequencies">Frequencies</a>)<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Digital_audio_broadcasting" title="Digital audio broadcasting" class="mw-redirect">DAB+</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./DVB-T" title="DVB-T">DVB-T</a> Ch-204<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Internet_radio" title="Internet radio">online</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Foxtel" title="Foxtel">Foxtel</a> - TV Channel 875 / Radio Channel 43</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Know the story</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">News / Talk</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>15 August 1994<span class="noprint"><span typeof="mw:Entity">;</span><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>26<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>years ago</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>(<span class="bday dtstart published updated">15 August 1994</span>)</span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://radio.abc.net.au/stations/news/live" class="external text">Live Stream</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.abc<wbr></wbr>.net<wbr></wbr>.au<wbr></wbr>/newsradio<wbr></wbr>/</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
