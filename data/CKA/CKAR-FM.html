<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/CKAR-FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>CKAR-FM</b>, is a community radio station which is operating as Hunters Bay Radio (The Bay) at 88.7 MHz (FM) in Huntsville, Ontario, Canada.  It is located in the District Municipality of Muskoka. </p><p>The Bay was originally created as an online internet radio station, Hunters Bay Radio received approval by the CRTC on November 21, 2013 to operate a terrestrial radio station at 88.7 MHz, with an average effective radiated power of 5,700 watts (non directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 182.1 metres). The station would eventually be issued its call sign, CKAR-FM. </p><p>Hunters Bay Radio transitioned to FM on May 18, 2014. In 2017 The Bay added studios in Gravenhurst, Ontario at the Sawdust City Brewery and broadcast live from time to time, with Gravenhurst focused talk shows provided volunteers. Plans for studios in Bracebridge and Dorset are in the works. On August 15, 2018,  Hunters Bay Radio Inc. submitted an application to operate a new FM transmitter at Bracebridge. The new transmitter in Bracebridge would operate at 104.7 MHz with 18,000 watts. The CRTC denied Hunters Bay Radio Inc.'s application to operate a new FM transmitter at Bracebridge on February 5, 2019.</p><p>On August 8, 2019, Hunters Bay Radio 88.7 FM was knocked off the air as a result of an arson that took place at its transmitter facility in Dwight that damaged the stations' equipment. A short time later, the station was restored with reduced power. A new transmitter was replaced and turned on October 8 that same year. </p><p>The CKAR call sign was used for a number of years at another station in Huntsville, known today as CFBK-FM; was also used at present-day CKDO in Oshawa, Ontario and a <i>defunct</i> television station in Armstrong, Ontario, known as CHFD-TV. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://muskokaradio.com/" class="external text">muskokaradio<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span><pre># ckar-fm (huntsville, ontario)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CKAR-FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png"><img resource="./File:CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png/150px-CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png" data-file-width="171" data-file-height="178" data-file-type="bitmap" height="156" width="150" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/CKAR_88.7_FM_The_Bay_Muskoka_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Huntsville,_Ontario" title="Huntsville, Ontario">Huntsville, Ontario</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>88.7 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>The Bay Muskoka</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Hunter's Bay Radio, Inc.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2014</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>5.7 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kilowatt" title="Kilowatt" class="mw-redirect">kilowatts</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Polarization_(antenna)" title="Polarization (antenna)" class="mw-redirect">horizontal</a> polarization only</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>182.1 meters (597<span typeof="mw:Entity"> </span>ft)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://muskokaradio.com/" class="external text">muskokaradio<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
