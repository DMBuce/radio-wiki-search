<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KLIB --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>KLIB</b> (1110 AM) is a radio station that broadcasts from Roseville, California, and serves Sacramento. The station broadcasts to the Asian community, and is owned by Multicultural Radio Broadcasting. The transmitter's broadcast power is 5,000 watts daytime, 500 watts nighttime. </p><p>The 1110 kHz frequency was previously used by stations KPOP, KPIP, KRCX. The station was taken off air in April 2006.</p><p>Companion AM Station KFSG (1690 kHz) was licensed for operations in 2001 [1] as part of the FCC's expanded AM band program.[2]  At the end of the 5-year period, the licensee (Way Broadcasting) would have to either discontinue operations in the expanded band or return the original license (KLIB in this case) and cease operations.  The station went silent in 2006 and removed its directional phasing equipment to comply, but also filed a request to retain both licenses.  On February 20, 2007, the FCC granted a temporary authority to resume operations using a lower power non-directional antenna pending the final disposition of the expanded band license issue. [3]</p><p>Originally, KLIB was a radio station licensed to Liberal Kansas at 1470 kHz on the AM band.  The transmitter, tower, and studio was just south of Highway 54 on the east side of town and was a 1000 watt omni daytime station.  The format in 1984/1985 was adult contemporary, and personalities on the air at that time was Paul Maldanado, Tim Malone, and John Jenkinson.  Max Libby was the General Manager. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=KLIB">Google Search</a><pre># klib (roseville, california/sacramento, california)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">KLIB</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Roseville,_California" title="Roseville, California">Roseville, California</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1110 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Hertz" title="Hertz">kHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Languages_of_Asia" title="Languages of Asia">Asian radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Multicultural_Broadcasting" title="Multicultural Broadcasting">Multicultural Broadcasting</a> <br>(Way Broadcasting Licensee, LLC)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>April 1, 1968</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>5,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> day<br>500 watts night</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
