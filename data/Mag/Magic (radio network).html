<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Magic_(radio_network) --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Magic</b> is a New Zealand classic hits and talkback radio network owned by MediaWorks New Zealand. The network targets New Zealand's growing population of baby boomers with a line-up of veteran broadcasters. Its music breakfast show, Magic Breakfast (formerly Magic in the Morning), is hosted by high-profile television producer, game show host, sports commentator and radio announcer Mark Leishman, while its talk breakfast show The AM Show is simulcast on TV channel Three and is presented by Duncan Garner, Amanda Gillies and Mark Richardson. </p><p><b>Magic Music</b> targets 50- to 69-year-olds, an older demographic than similar MediaWorks brands. It is run alongside The Breeze with a similar playlist, but The Breeze has a younger female skew and easy listening music focus. Another MediaWorks network, The Sound, previously played similar music but now has a male skew and a rock music focus. Magic targets older listeners who have a "youthful, active approach to life" and want "fantastic music and a feel-good attitude". However, some marketing commentators have argued the "youthful" brand is out of touch with the "antiquated" classic playlist. Its playlist, drawn from the 1950s to 1970s, includes music from Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield and Rod Stewart.</p><p><b>Magic Talk</b> is a nationwide Auckland-based talkback, news and sport radio network, formed by the 2019 rebrand of Radio Live. The station competes directly against NZME station Newstalk ZB. Magic was rebranded as Magic Music, and some programmes shared with the newly-launched Magic Talk. This change took effect in mid-January 2019, with a large number of Radio Live hosts leaving the station due to the restructure. The first programme hosted on the station was Overnights with Tony Amos. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.magic.co.nz/home.player.music.html" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.magic<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz<wbr></wbr>/home<wbr></wbr>.player<wbr></wbr>.music<wbr></wbr>.html</a></span> (Magic Music)<br><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.magic.co.nz/home.player.talk.html" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.magic<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz<wbr></wbr>/home<wbr></wbr>.player<wbr></wbr>.talk<wbr></wbr>.html</a></span> (Magic Talk)<pre># magic music & talk (16 markets in new zealand)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBA"><caption class="fn org">Magic Music &amp; Talk</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">16 markets in New Zealand</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>"Turn up the feel good" (Music)<br>"Turn up the conversation" (Talk)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Classic_hits" title="Classic hits">Classic hits</a> (Magic Music)<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Talk_radio" title="Talk radio">Talk radio</a> (Magic Talk)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MediaWorks_Radio" title="MediaWorks Radio">MediaWorks Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>20 April 2015 (Magic Music)<br>19 January 2019 (Magic Talk)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.magic.co.nz/home.player.music.html" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.magic<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz<wbr></wbr>/home<wbr></wbr>.player<wbr></wbr>.music<wbr></wbr>.html</a></span> (Magic Music)<br><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.magic.co.nz/home.player.talk.html" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.magic<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz<wbr></wbr>/home<wbr></wbr>.player<wbr></wbr>.talk<wbr></wbr>.html</a></span> (Magic Talk)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://magic.co.nz" class="external text">magic<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.nz</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
