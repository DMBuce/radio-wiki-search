<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WIXC --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WIXC</b> is an AM Spanish-language sports radio station licensed to Titusville, Florida, United States. It broadcasts on a medium-wave frequency of 1060 kHz. It is owned by Genesis Communications. It broadcasts from a 50 kW transmitter in Titusville, though the transmitter power is reduced to 17 kW during critical hours and further reduced in power overnight to 5 kW. Its primary service area is the northern half of Brevard County, with its main studio and transmitter in Mims, north of Titusville. A sales office formerly located in the Suntree area of Melbourne, Florida was closed. </p><p>WIXC was the Space Coast affiliate for ESPN Radio through July 31, 2008. It was also the local affiliate for the Tampa Bay Rays games, as well as NASCAR NEXTEL Cup races. WIXC switched from its previous sports talk format to primarily classic country music on August 1, 2008. It dumped the classic country format after two months and before one ratings period had taken place when its LMA deal with Whiskey River Broadcasting, Inc. fell apart, and went gone to a news/talk format with a significant amount of brokered paid programming. WIXC continues to air a significant amount of sports content. It became Brevard County's flagship station for live high school football broadcasts in the fall of 2009 but lost that programming to WMEL 1300. </p><p>The WIXC call sign was previously used by FM 97.3 in Bay City, Michigan, now WMJO. </p><p>On August 9, 2015, WIXC became <i>AM 1060 WMEL</i>. On October 31, 2016 at noon, WIXC returned to the <i>NewsTalk 1060</i> brand when "WMEL" moved its programming to WWBC AM 1510.</p><p>On February 4, 2019, WIXC flipped to a Regional Mexican format, in a trimulcast with WTMP-FM and WMGG. Just over a month later, WIXC split away from the trimulcast, picking up Spanish-language sports ESPN Deportes Radio. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=WIXC">Google Search</a><pre># wixc (titusville, florida)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">WIXC</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Titusville,_Florida" title="Titusville, Florida">Titusville, Florida</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Brevard_County,_Florida" title="Brevard County, Florida">Brevard County</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1060 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KHz" title="KHz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sports_radio" title="Sports radio">sports</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Genesis Communications</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1957_in_radio" title="1957 in radio">1957</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WRMF (1965-1979), WAMT (1979-2001)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>54505</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>50,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> (day)<br>17,000 watts (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Critical_hours" title="Critical hours">critical hours</a>)<br>5,000 watts (night)</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
