<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WDTR --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WDTR</b> is a non-commercial, Christian FM radio station licensed to serve Imlay City, Michigan.  It is owned by Michigan Community Radio, which is in turn owned by Jennifer and Edward Czelada.  The station is part of their Smile FM network of Contemporary Christian music stations. </p><p>The station came on the air on December 18, 2000 with the callsign WHYT. It was the flagship of the Joy-FM network of stations planned by the Czeladas.  In June 2004, the two networks owned by Jennifer and Edward Czelada, The Light and Joy-FM, were merged to form Smile FM. </p><p>In August 2004, the station switched call letters with its sister station on 88.1.  The new WHYT remained in the Smile FM network while the older station switched to a traditional Christian music format and began calling itself Classic Christian Radio International. </p><p>In January 2008, WDTR switched to a Christian contemporary worship music format calling itself Smile FM Praise with the call letters WWKM.  WWKM was to be the flagship of the Smile FM Praise network. After the Smile FM Praise format was discontinued, the station switched back to the main Smile FM network in preparation for an increase in power and move to 88.9 from a tower near Oxford (see below).  On April 20, 2011, the station took the call letters of the Smile FM Monroe, Michigan affiliate WDTR.  That station switched to WSMF to honor a pastor from the Monroe area. </p><p>The station had approval from the FCC to move its transmitter closer to Detroit and increase power to 6,000 watts.  However, the construction permit expired on April 7, 2009.  On August 26, 2009, WDTR was granted a construction permit for 6,000 watts effective radiated power on 88.9 from a different tower near Oxford. That facility was not built before the construction permit expired on August 26, 2012. On August 27, 2012 the station applied for a new permit for 5,000 watts. According to the station affiliate list on the Smile FM web site, WDTR will broadcast the main Smile FM network programming to the Rochester area and northern suburbs of Detroit.  The coverage area will include portions of Oakland, Macomb, St. Clair, and Lapeer counties.  This new facility was built and became active on August 3, 2016 with its new transmitter in Leonard, near Romeo. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=WDTR">Google Search</a><pre># wdtr (imlay city, michigan)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WDTR</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Imlay_City,_Michigan" title="Imlay City, Michigan">Imlay City, Michigan</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=WDTR-FM&amp;s=C" class="external autonumber"></a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>88.9 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./MHz" title="MHz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Smile FM</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Michigan's Positive Hits</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Religious_broadcasting" title="Religious broadcasting">Religious</a>; <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Contemporary_Christian" title="Contemporary Christian" class="mw-redirect">Contemporary Christian</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Michigan_Community_Radio" title="Michigan Community Radio" class="new">Michigan Community Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>December 18, 2000</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WHYT (12/1/00-8/9/04)<br>WWKM (8/10/04-4/11/11)<br>WSMF (4/11/11-4/20/11)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former frequencies</div></th><td>89.1 MHz (2001-2016)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>W</b> <b>D</b>e<b>TR</b>oit</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>3,200 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>61 meters</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
