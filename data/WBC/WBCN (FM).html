<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WBCN_(FM) --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WBCN</b> was an over-the-air radio station in Boston, Massachusetts. Originally broadcasting on analog 104.1 MHz (now WWBX) from 1968 to 2009, and later broadcasting as a digital-only radio station, airing on WBZ-FM HD2 from 2009 to 2017. In December 2017, owner Beasley Broadcast Group discontinued WBCN, switching the station's format to "Hubcast", a replay of segments and podcasts from air personalities of the Sports Talk format of WBZ-FM. </p><p>Before switching to 98.5 HD2 on August 12, 2009, WBCN featured its rock format for 41 years as an analog radio station on 104.1 MHz. WBCN became a legend in the rock music industry for breaking many bands, most notably U2.  WBCN was a modern rock/active rock station that mixed music that has been popular in the modern rock, alternative rock and classic rock genres. Known as "The Rock of Boston", its three main Boston-area competitors as of 2009 were Album Oriented Rock/active rock WAAF and alternative music stations WBOS and WFNX. </p><p>The station switched to digital only on August 12, 2009, with two digital-only automated streams, one continuing the modern rock format, the other <b>Free Form BCN</b>, airing an eclectic mix of rock, related genres, and a lot of new music - essentially the WBCN of 1968 to 1988, brought into the 21st Century. The station's battle of the bands' competition, the Rock 'n' Roll Rumble, survived the station's demise. WBCN's celebrated local music specialty show, Boston Emissions—along with The Rumble—moved to sister station WZLX in 2009. Boston DJ Anngelle Wood remains the host and music director of both the radio show and The Rumble—these are the last remaining ties to the original 104.1 WBCN programming.</p><p>"Free Form BCN" began airing live freeform shows in September 2009 on WZLX-HD3 and at wbcn.com. While still digital and largely automated, the online stream was live Monday through Friday during the day. WBCN's first rock program director, Sam Kopper, was Program Director of WBCN Free Form Rock until being discontinued on January 29, 2016. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=WBCN (FM)">Google Search</a><pre># wbcn (boston, massachusetts)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwBw"><caption class="fn org">WBCN</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:WBCN_98_Point_five_FM.png"><img resource="./File:WBCN_98_Point_five_FM.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/WBCN_98_Point_five_FM.png" data-file-width="145" data-file-height="145" data-file-type="bitmap" height="145" width="145"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts" class="mw-redirect">Boston, Massachusetts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Greater_Boston" title="Greater Boston">Greater Boston</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>WBCN</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>The Rock of Boston</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Modern_rock" title="Modern rock">Modern rock</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>Analog: March 15, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1968_in_radio" title="1968 in radio">1968</a><br>Digital: August 12, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2009_in_radio" title="2009 in radio">2009</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>December <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./2017_in_radio" title="2017 in radio">2017</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>B</b>oston <b>C</b>oncert <b>N</b>etwork (original format)</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
