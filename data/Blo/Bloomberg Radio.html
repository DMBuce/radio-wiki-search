<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Bloomberg_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Bloomberg Radio</b> is a radio service of Bloomberg L.P. that provides global business news programming 24 hours a day. The format is general and financial news, offering local, national and international news reports along with financial market updates and interviews with corporate executives, economists and industry analysts. On off hours, local stations may preempt with local sports play-by-play coverage such as college basketball, tennis and other sports coverage. </p><p>Bloomberg Radio is broadcast on radio stations around the United States, and directly operates five radio stations: </p> <ul><li>WBBR 1130 AM in New York City</li> <li>WRCA 1330 AM in Watertown-Boston and WNBP 1450 AM Newburyport-Boston along with two FM translators at 106.1Â MHz.</li> <li>KNEW 960 AM in Oakland-San Francisco</li> <li>WDCH-FM 99.1 FM in Bowie, Maryland, serving Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.</li></ul><p>Bloomberg purchased the first of these, WBBR (at the time designated as WNEW), in 1992, for $13.5 million. Bloomberg took over the operation of WXKS (1200 AM) in Newton (serving Boston) on March 1, 2013 and KNEW on September 29, 2014. Both stations are owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications), but are programmed by Bloomberg Radio under a local marketing agreement (LMA).  On December 21, 2015, Bloomberg Radio launched a similar arrangement on CBS Radio-owned WNEW-FM, its first FM radio station. The call letters of WNEW-FM were later changed to WDCH-FM. Bloomberg moved its programming in Boston to WRCA, owned by Beasley Media Group, on July 4, 2017, and later that year fully acquired WNBP (1450 AM) in Newburyport to serve as a simulcast of WRCA (both WRCA and WNBP operate translator stations on 106.1 FM); its LMA with WXKS expired on March 1, 2018. Bloomberg Radio is also heard nationally on SiriusXM satellite radio channel 119. Select programming is also broadcast in London, UK on DAB digital radio via the London 3 multiplex (VHF block 11B), with simulcasts of the Bloomberg TV audio at other times. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/audio" class="external text">Listen live</a><pre># bloomberg radio (worldwide)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Bloomberg Radio</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Bloomberg_Radio.png"><img resource="./File:Bloomberg_Radio.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bloomberg_Radio.png/220px-Bloomberg_Radio.png" data-file-width="921" data-file-height="110" data-file-type="bitmap" height="26" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bloomberg_Radio.png/330px-Bloomberg_Radio.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bloomberg_Radio.png/440px-Bloomberg_Radio.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">worldwide</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Bloomberg Radio</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>"The World is Listening."</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Financial News</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bloomberg_L.P." title="Bloomberg L.P.">Bloomberg L.P.</a> <br>(Bloomberg Communications Inc.)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/audio" class="external text">Listen live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.bloombergradio.com/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.bloombergradio<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
