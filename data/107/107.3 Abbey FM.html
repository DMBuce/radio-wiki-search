The station ceased transmission at 3pm on 30 January 2009 and was placed into administration with the loss of seven jobs. This followed one of the station's main backers, The Local Radio Company, withdrawing their support three weeks earlier. The Station Manager at the time Amanda Bell told the North West Evening Mail that this "forced the hand of the other shareholders" and that she was only informed of their decision on the day of the closure at 12.30pm.</p><p>Abbey FM was owned by The Radio Business Ltd (35%), CN Group Ltd (30%) and The Local Radio Company Ltd (35%).
