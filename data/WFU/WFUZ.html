<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WFUZ --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WFUZ</b> (92.1 FM) is a radio station in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, serving the greater Wilkes-Barre-Scranton area.  It is owned by Times-Shamrock Communications. </p><p>In addition, it was the flagship station of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins until 2009. Tom Grace was the play-by-play announcer for the "baby Pens" for the majority of the franchise's existence prior to the 2007–2008 season, when former local TV weatherman Scott Stuccio replaced him. The 2007–2008 season also marked the first time that the Q split its music feed from the hockey game, giving listeners who wanted to continue to listen to music during games the option of doing so on 100.1 (WQFN). </p><p>WQFM was formerly an oldies station, known as "Oldies 92 and 100", then switched to Hot AC branded as "QFM" and later "The Q." On June 30, 2008, the station dropped the Hot AC format and began playing music exclusively from the Beatles. On July 3, 2008, the station switched back to an oldies format, branded as "Cool 92.1 and 100.1". </p><p>On September 16, 2010 WQFM changed their format to alternative rock, branded as "FM 92.1" and changed their call letters to <b>WFUZ</b>. WQFN now simulcasts ESPN Radio from WEJL.
