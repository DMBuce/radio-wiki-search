<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WVHU --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WVHU</b> is a talk radio station in the Huntington, West Virginia market. Its offerings are similar to other news talk stations owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., as it is the home for Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. The station also carries live play-by-play of the Cincinnati Reds. </p><p>Previously, rival station WRVC, carried the Reds and Limbaugh, until Clear Channel acquired the station and moved the programming. WVHU is simulcasted on WZZW, located to the east in Milton, West Virginia and covering the Teays Valley area. This gives the station the range of a more powerful station. Previously it was also simulcasted on WIRO located to the west, but this station was dropped on April 6, 2009. </p><p>In recent years the station has led the market in AM radio listenership. </p><p>Prior to adapting a news-talk format, WVHU used the call sign WKEE (which is used by an FM station in Huntington) and featured a Top 40 music format. With its daytime signal extending beyond the Tri-State region centered on Huntington-Ashland-Ironton, the former WKEE was the major Top 40 station for Eastern Kentucky, Southern Ohio, and Northern West Virginia. During that era, WKEE used the slogan "The Tri-State's Friendly Giant." Before becoming WKEE, the station was known as WHTN and it was under those call signs that comedian Soupy Sales began his career as a writer and disc jockey. </p><p>WHTN began broadcasting in July 1947 as a daytime station on 800Â kHz with 1 KW power, licensed to the Greater Huntington Radio Corp.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.800wvhu.com" class="external text">800wvhu.com</a><pre># wvhu (huntington, west virginia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WVHU</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:WVHU_NewsRadio800_logo.png"><img resource="./File:WVHU_NewsRadio800_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/WVHU_NewsRadio800_logo.png" data-file-width="150" data-file-height="78" data-file-type="bitmap" height="78" width="150"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Huntington,_West_Virginia" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Huntington,_West_Virginia" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>800 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kilohertz" title="Kilohertz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>News Radio 800</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td><i>Huntington's Home for News</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./News_radio" title="News radio" class="mw-redirect">News</a>/<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Talk_radio" title="Talk radio">Talk</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./IHeartMedia,_Inc." title="IHeartMedia, Inc." class="mw-redirect">iHeartMedia, Inc.</a> <br>(Capstar TX LLC)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>W</b>est <b>V</b>irginia <b>HU</b>ntington</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>5,000 watts (daytime) <br> 185 watts (nighttime)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.800wvhu.com" class="external text">800wvhu.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
