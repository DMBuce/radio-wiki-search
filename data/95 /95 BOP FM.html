The station was originally branded as it is callsign 1ZD and broadcasts on 1000AM. </p><p>In 1978 the AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing as a result 1ZD moved to 1008AM. </p><p>In the 1980s 1ZD became known as <i>Radio BOP</i> and relocated to the Bay Savings Bank building on Devonport Road in Tauranga.

For 95 BOP FM the station became known as <i>Classic Hits 95 BOP FM</i>. In the early nineties Radio New Zealand also began rolling Newstalk ZB out across the country. The 1008AM frequency was replaced with Newstalk ZB. </p><p>In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits branded stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News &amp; Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network.</p><p>In 1998 Classic Hits 95 BOP FM was reduced to just 4 hours of local programming between 6 and 10 am 7 days a week.
