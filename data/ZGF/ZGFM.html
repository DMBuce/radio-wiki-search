<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/ZGFM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>ZGFM</b> was a radio station in Gisborne, New Zealand. </p><p>The station was originally started by Radio New Zealand on 1010 AM with the callsign 2XG. The station callsign and branding was later changed to <i>2ZG</i>. </p><p>In 1978 2ZG moved to 945AM, the change in frequency was due to the New Zealand AM band changing from 10 kHz frequency spacing to 9 kHz spacing. Coinciding with the change the station became known on air as <i>The Coaster 2ZG</i>. </p><p>The Coaster 2ZG began broadcasting on 90.9FM during the 1990s and was rebranded as ZGFM. </p><p>In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included ZGFM. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News &amp; Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network.</p><p>In 1998 The Radio Network grouped all their local stations in smaller markets together to form the Community Radio Network. ZGFM continued to run a local breakfast show between 6am and 10am but outside breakfast all stations part of the Community Radio Network took network programming from a central studio based in Taupo. </p><p>In 2001 the Community Radio Network was discontinued and all stations become part of the Classic Hits FM network, as a result ZGFM was rebranded as Classic Hits 90.9 ZGFM. The station continued to run a local breakfast but now outside breakfast all programming originated from the Classic Hits studios in Auckland. The original 945AM frequency was replaced with Newstalk ZB. </p><p>On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. The local 9am-3pm show is presented by Connor Ruston. </p><p>The studios were located on the corner of Grey Street and Childers Road in Gisborne which has now been reutilised as a restaurant and bar. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://iheart.com/live/the-hits-gisborne-6212/" class="external text">Livestream</a></span><pre># zgfm (gisborne)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCg"><caption class="fn org">ZGFM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Gisborne,_New_Zealand" title="Gisborne, New Zealand">Gisborne</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><span class="hMeasure frequency"><span class="num">90.9</span> <span class="unit">MHz</span></span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Language(s)</th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./English_language" title="English language">English language</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_contemporary_music" title="Adult contemporary music">Adult contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_New_Zealand" title="Radio New Zealand">Radio New Zealand</a> until 1996 <br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./The_Radio_Network" title="The Radio Network" class="mw-redirect">The Radio Network</a> after 1996</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>2ZG</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Transmitter coordinates</div></th><td><span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=ZGFM&amp;params=38.6648429_S_178.0174872_E_type:landmark_region:NZ" class="external text"><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">38°39′53″S</span> <span class="longitude">178°01′03″E</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">38.6648429°S 178.0174872°E</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">-38.6648429; 178.0174872</span></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span id="coordinates"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Geographic_coordinate_system" title="Geographic coordinate system">Coordinates</a>: <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=ZGFM&amp;params=38.6648429_S_178.0174872_E_type:landmark_region:NZ" class="external text"><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">38°39′53″S</span> <span class="longitude">178°01′03″E</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">38.6648429°S 178.0174872°E</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">-38.6648429; 178.0174872</span></span></span></a></span></span></span><link rel="mw:PageProp/Category" href="./Category:Coordinates_on_Wikidata"></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://iheart.com/live/the-hits-gisborne-6212/" class="external text">Livestream</a></span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://thehits.co.nz/shows/gisborne/" class="external text">Official website</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
