<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Takeover_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Takeover Radio</b> is a community radio station broadcasting on FM to Leicester, to the Ashfield district in Nottinghamshire and on the Internet, specialising in helping children gain experience and direct participative involvement in radio broadcasting.  </p><p>Takeover Radio 103.2FM was the first 'Takeover' station to be set up, which broadcasts to Leicestershire on 103.2FM and Worldwide on the Web. Takeover Radio 106.9 was the second 'Takeover' station to be set up, which broadcasts to the district of Ashfield on 106.9FM and Worldwide on the Web. Both stations have a 24/7 on-air schedule. </p><p>Created in 1996, it enjoyed several years output as a programme format on short-term temporary licence stations. Takeover Radio's first full-time broadcasting output was achieved with the award of one of the first 15 licensed UK Pilot Access Radio stations by the (then) UK Radio Authority in 2001. This was followed by the grant of a Community Radio licence by the now current UK Government regulator Ofcom in 2005.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.takeoverradio.co.uk" class="external text">www.takeoverradio.co.uk</a><pre># takeover radio 103.2 (sutton in ashfield)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Takeover Radio 103.2</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Leicester" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>, Leicestershire</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>103.2 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Hertz" title="Hertz">MHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Youth Pop</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Takeover Radio Children's Media Trust</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>5 March 2002</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.takeoverradio.co.uk" class="external text">www.takeoverradio.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table><hr/>
