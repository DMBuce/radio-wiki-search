<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Aboriginal_Voices_Radio_Network --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Aboriginal Voices Radio Network</b> (rebranded as <b>Voices Radio</b> in 2014) was a Canadian radio network, which primarily broadcast music programming and other content of interest to aboriginal people. As of June 2015, the network operated stations in Toronto, Ontario (where its studios and offices were located), Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, and Vancouver, British Columbia. All of its stations were licensed as rebroadcasters of its flagship station, <b>CKAV-FM</b> in Toronto. The network's administrative office was located in Ohsweken, Ontario, on the Six Nations Indian reserve near Brantford. The stations' music programming consisted mainly of adult contemporary music (including both mainstream and indigenous artists), along with specialty programs focusing on aboriginal-oriented content. </p><p>On June 25, 2015, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revoked Voices Radio's broadcast licenses effective July 25, 2015, citing a long-term history of non-compliance with conditions of their licenses. The CRTC issued a call for applications for new radio services in the markets vacated by the network, with special priority given to new First Nations services. The suspension was stayed on July 23, 2015  by the Federal Court of Appeal, pending the outcome of a request for a leave to appeal the CRTC's decision. The stay was lifted on November 10, 2016 when AVR lost its appeal and the network left the air shortly afterwards.</p><b>URL:</b> www.voicesradio.ca <p>www.aboriginalvoices.com</p> www.avrradio.com <br><i><b>(All dead links)</b></i><pre># ckav-fm (toronto, ontario)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">CKAV-FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg"><img resource="./File:Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg/220px-Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg" data-file-width="260" data-file-height="57" data-file-type="bitmap" height="48" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Aboriginal_Voices_logo.jpg 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">national</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>various</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Voices Radio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Adult_contemporary" title="Adult contemporary" class="mw-redirect">adult contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Aboriginal Voices Radio Inc.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2002</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>November 2016</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>CFIE-FM (2002-2006)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td>www.voicesradio.ca <p>www.aboriginalvoices.com</p> www.avrradio.com <br><i><b>(All dead links)</b></i></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
