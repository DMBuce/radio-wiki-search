<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Vanderbilt_Sports_Network --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p>The <b>Vanderbilt IMG Sports Network</b>, also known as the <b>Commodore Radio Network</b>, is the sports radio network for the Vanderbilt Commodores, the athletic programs of Vanderbilt University. Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, the network consists of 10 radio stations in Middle Tennessee, and one in Kentucky. </p><p>There is no television division of this network, but Vanderbilt Commodores fans worldwide can listen to coaches shows and game events on Vanderbilt Access at the athletic department's website. IMG College has been operating the Vanderbilt Sports network since 2000.</p><p>Since 2012, WLAC, known on air as "NewsRadio 1510," is the Nashville area home (and flagship station) of Vanderbilt sports programming. Because that station is a 50,000 clear-channel AM station, Vanderbilt's night-time games can be heard in most of the eastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada. WSM, the other clear-channel station in Nashville, previously served as the network's flagship from the 1950s through 2012. WLAC took over as flagship station two years after losing rival Vol Network's broadcasts of Tennessee Volunteers basketball and football games to WGFX-FM. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://vucommodores.com/allaccess" class="external text">VUCommodores All Access</a> (online game broadcasts)<pre># vanderbilt img sports network (nashville, tennessee)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">Vanderbilt IMG Sports Network</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Nashville,_Tennessee" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Middle_Tennessee" title="Middle Tennessee">Middle Tennessee</a> <br> South Central and <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Western_Kentucky" title="Western Kentucky">Western</a> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>various <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a> and <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./FM_broadcasting" title="FM broadcasting">FM</a> radio stations</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Regional <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sports_radio" title="Sports radio">Sports radio</a> network (Satellite-delivered)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./IMG_College" title="IMG College" class="mw-redirect">IMG College</a> <br> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Vanderbilt_University" title="Vanderbilt University">Vanderbilt University</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://vucommodores.com/allaccess" class="external text">VUCommodores All Access</a> (online game broadcasts)</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
