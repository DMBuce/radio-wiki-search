<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Demon_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>DemonFM</b> is a student radio station based at De Montfort University in Leicester, England. The station broadcasts online during term time.  It was established in 1995 by the Communications Officer of the time, Rob Martin.  The first licensed broadcast was on 106.4 FM from 29 September 1995 to 26 October 1995, the second broadcast on 106.2 FM from 22 April 1996 to 19 May 1996.  DemonFM continued to broadcast on Restricted Service Licences until 2008 with the last of the RSL broadcasts taking place on 97.5FM.  DemonFM finished their 26th and final RSL on 30 November 2008. </p><p>DemonFM then held a community radio licence between May 2009 and 2019 with broadcasts taking place 24/7/365, it broadcast on 107.5FM with coverage over the Greater Leicester Area (with approximately five miles coverage from the university campus).  DemonFM had its community radio licence renewed for a further five years in 2014 with its last broadcast on FM taking place on Friday 3 May 2019. </p><p>The station is part of De Montfort Students' Union's Demon Media group which also comprises The Demon magazine and Demon TV. </p><p>In 2018 a decision was made by the management board of the station to not apply for a second extension of its community radio licence.  While never publicly communicated, the station management told its members that it wished to focus solely on providing an experience for De Montfort University Students.  The Chief Executive Officer of De Montfort University Students' Union Penni Robson cited undesirable administration burdens, costs and an unwillingness to service community broadcasters as the reason for not supporting the renewal of the licence. Leicester Community Radio had indicated a strong willingness to take over the licence with some support from Ofcom, but De Montford University Students' Union elected to hand back the license tc Ofcom rather than transfer to a community organisation, leaving Leicester with one less community radio station and 107.5mhz vacant in the area. Ofcom has announced they have no plans for the foreseeable future to advertise any further FM community radio licences in Leicester, leaving this frequency vacant for the foreseeable future. </p><p>The station now broadcasts from 8 AM to midnight during term time. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.demonfm.co.uk/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.demonfm<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.uk</a></span><pre># demonfm (leicester, england)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">DemonFM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:DemonFM_New_Logo.png"><img resource="./File:DemonFM_New_Logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/DemonFM_New_Logo.png/150px-DemonFM_New_Logo.png" data-file-width="494" data-file-height="374" data-file-type="bitmap" height="114" width="150" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/DemonFM_New_Logo.png/225px-DemonFM_New_Logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/DemonFM_New_Logo.png/300px-DemonFM_New_Logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Leicester" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./England" title="England">England</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Leicester's No.1 Student Station</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Campus_radio" title="Campus radio">Student Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>De Monfort University Students' Union</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>29/09/1995 (Restricted Services Licence (RSL))<br>04/05/2009 (Community Radio Licence)<br>04/05/2019 (Online Only Station)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.demonfm.co.uk/" class="external text">www<wbr></wbr>.demonfm<wbr></wbr>.co<wbr></wbr>.uk</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
