<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/2NCR --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>2NCR</b> is amongst the earliest licensed non-metrolitan FM community radio stations in New South Wales, Australia. </p><p>Originally, the licence was issued to the nearby Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education, however with the re-structure of the university system in the late 1990s, the university became a campus of the newly established Southern Cross University. This new university was not interested in maintaining its broadcast licence - thus a new association was formed to take over control of the community licence. This association was North Coast Radio Inc. </p><p>The 2NCR callsign has been used without interruption since inception, and is still the official callsign for the station today. More recently, 2NCR had rebranded to <i>92.9 FM (2NCR)</i> or <i>92Nine</i>, and in recent months re-branded to "River-FM". </p><p>2NCR / River FM features many community radio program elements, including interview programs, non-English languages, specialist music programs and news. The genre based music programs presented by the station include Blues, Jazz, Indigenous, and country music. </p><p>The station's news is provided by the community radio news service National Radio News (or NRN) </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.2ncr.org.au" class="external free">http://www.2ncr.org.au</a><pre># 2ncr / river fm (lismore, new south wales, australia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">2NCR / River FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td>Lismore, New South Wales, Australia</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>92.9<span typeof="mw:Entity">Â </span>MHz</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Diverse</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Community_Broadcasting_Association_of_Australia" title="Community Broadcasting Association of Australia">CBAA</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>North Coast Radio Inc</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td>2 <b>N</b>orth <b>C</b>oast <b>R</b>adio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>Parrots Nest, NSW, Australia</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">Community</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>500 w</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.2ncr.org.au" class="external free">http://www.2ncr.org.au</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
