<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/United_Biscuits_Network --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>United Biscuits Network</b> (or <b>UBN</b> for short) was an internal radio station serving the factories of United Biscuits (UB) in Britain that operated from 1970 to 1979.</p><p>In 1970 the BBC had a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain, although there were a few offshore pirate radio broadcasters, such as Radio Caroline. At one time factories had sought to avoid irrelevant sound, but during the Second World War psychologists found that light background music—muzak—increased productivity at times it was low, a trend that continued after the war. But as jobs became deskilled and ever more monotonous, muzak became less effective, and staff turnover increased.  United Biscuits was affected by this trend; Hector Laing, the managing director in the 1960s, needed to reduce the costs of high staff turnover. Inspired by the success of the pirate stations, Laing hired suitable staff, bought state-of-the-art broadcasting equipment, and set up UBN at UB headquarters in Osterley, west London (later the headquarters of broadcaster Sky UK). </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=United Biscuits Network">Google Search</a><pre># united biscuits network (unknown location)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">United Biscuits Network</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td><i>The Home of Good Baking</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Popular_Music" title="Popular Music" class="mw-redirect">Popular Music</a> and Speech</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>United Biscuits</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1970 to 1979</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
