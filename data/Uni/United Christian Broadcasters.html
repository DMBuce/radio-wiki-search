Through affiliates in twenty five countries, it operates radio and television stations and publishes and broadcasts Bob Gass's free daily devotionals The Word for You Today and Word For You (young adults' version) </p><p>The group was started in New Zealand by Richard Berry. In the early 1960s, the Christchurch evangelical was inspired by Ecuadorian Christian short-wave radio station HCJB to set up a radio station in his garage. The station became a permanent operation in 1976, and in subsequent years it expanded throughout New Zealand. </p><p>The Rhema model was used to establish UCB affiliates in Australia, the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, and beyond. In July 2010, UCB United Kingdom's UCB TV partnered with the mobile TV and video on demand network Yamgo to launch the world's first ever live Christian mobile TV channel.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.ucb.co.uk/player" class="external text">UCB Player</a><pre># united christian broadcasters (united kingdom)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt7" typeof="mw:Transclusion" data-mw='{"parts":[{"template":{"target":{"wt":"Infobox company\n","href":"./Template:Infobox_company"},"params":{"name":{"wt":"United Christian Broadcasters"},"predecessor":{"wt":""},"foundation":{"wt":"[[Christchurch]], New Zealand ({{Start date|df=yes|1960s}})"},"location_city":{"wt":"[[Auckland]]"},"location_country":{"wt":"New Zealand"},"location":{"wt":""},"locations":{"wt":""},"area_served":{"wt":""},"key_people":{"wt":"Hal Short &lt;small&gt;(President)&lt;/small&gt;"},"industry":{"wt":"Broadcasting"},"products":{"wt":""},"services":{"wt":""},"owner":{"wt":""},"parent":{"wt":""},"homepage":{"wt":"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080821015128/http://www.ucbmedia.com/ International]"},"footnotes":{"wt":""},"intl":{"wt":""}},"i":0}}]}' id="mwCw"><caption class="fn org">United Christian Broadcasters</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row" style="padding-right: 0.5em;">Industry</th><td class="category" style="line-height: 1.35em;">Broadcasting</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" style="padding-right: 0.5em;">Founded</th><td style="line-height: 1.35em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Christchurch" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, New Zealand (1960s<span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">Â </span>(<span class="bday dtstart published updated">1960s</span>)</span>)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" style="padding-right: 0.5em;">Headquarters</th><td class="adr" style="line-height: 1.35em;"><div style="display: inline;" class="locality"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Auckland" title="Auckland">Auckland</a></div>, <div style="display: inline;" class="country-name">New Zealand</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" style="padding-right: 0.5em;"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Key people</div></th><td class="agent" style="line-height: 1.35em;">Hal Short <small>(President)</small></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" style="padding-right: 0.5em;">Website</th><td style="line-height: 1.35em;"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080821015128/http://www.ucbmedia.com/" class="external text">International</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
