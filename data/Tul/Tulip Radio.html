<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Tulip_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Tulip Radio</b> was the local community radio station covering the area of Spalding, Lincolnshire, England. The name was linked to Spalding's  heavy involvement with the horticulture industry. The town was famous for its tulips, and used to host an annual Flower Parade (originally the Tulip parade) every May. The station had a float in the Spalding Flower Parade. Founded in 2001 as 'Tulip FM', and renaming in 2006 to Tulip Radio, in April 2008 the station was awarded an initial 5-year full-time community radio licence by Ofcom, the UK Media regulator. The station commenced full-time broadcasting on 12 June 2009.</p><p>Tulip Radio was one of few radio stations nationally to offer media training to secondary students in local schools from its studios in The Crescent, originally funded by the leader+ scheme. Some of the students went on to present shows on the station. The station was regularly involved in community events such as the Annual Spalding Pumpkin Festival, the Flower Parade, Food Festival as well as Macmillan Cancer Support events &amp; Springfields fireworks.</p><p>In 2007, the station also took on the job of finding the South Holland Flower Queen to be the leading lady of the  Spalding Flower Parade. On 3 December 2011 Tulip Radio organised, on behalf of Spalding &amp; Area Chamber of Commerce, the Christmas Lights Switch On.</p><p>As well as its own broadcasts, it joined the Blackfriars Arts Centre in helping to set up a radio station in Boston, Lincolnshire, formally known as <i>Stump Radio</i> which broadcasts during July on 87.7 FM. Stump eventually went on to become Endeavour Radio and is still going on.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.tulip-radio.co.uk" class="external text">www.tulip-radio.co.uk</a><pre># tulip radio (south lincolnshire)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Tulip Radio</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Tulip107FM_logo.png"><img resource="./File:Tulip107FM_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Tulip107FM_logo.png" data-file-width="155" data-file-height="108" data-file-type="bitmap" height="108" width="155"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Lincolnshire" title="Lincolnshire">South Lincolnshire</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>107.5 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Hertz" title="Hertz">MHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Community</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Tulip Radio Ltd</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>12 June 2009 - 30 January 2017</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.tulip-radio.co.uk" class="external text">www.tulip-radio.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
