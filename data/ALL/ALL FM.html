<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/ALL_FM --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p><b>ALL FM</b> is a local community radio station serving south, central and east Manchester and based in the South Manchester suburb of Levenshulme. The station is run by paid staff and volunteers living in its coverage area. </p><p>ALL FM began in 2000 as a project of the charity Radio Regen, with a four-day broadcast under the title <b>Radio Longsight</b>. After the success of Radio Longsight, ALL FM was created, with station manager Dave Lenaghan, covering the Longsight area and the neighbouring areas of Ardwick and Levenshulme (hence the acronym ALL). As ALL FM, two RSL broadcasting licences were obtained, allowing ALL FM to transmit on a temporary basis. </p><p>In 2002, the station became part of the government's 'Access Radio' pilot scheme. ALL FM became an independent company and was granted a permanent broadcasting licence in 2005.</p><p>Catering to an area described by the founders as "one of the most multicultural outside London",.  The wide variety of programming includes French, Cantonese, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Panjabi and Hindi.  In 2015 poet and broadcaster Lemn Sissay became patron of ALL FM.  He said he loved the diversity of the station and it was (as far as he knew) the only station to have played his track 'Architecture'. In 2019, international musician Aziz Ibrahim (guitarist who works with The Stone Roses &amp; many other artists) took over as patron. ALL FM's sister station WFM 97.2 broadcasts to the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, a few miles south of the ALL FM target area. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ALL FM">Google Search</a><pre># all fm (south, central and east manchester, uk)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt3" id="mwBg"><caption class="fn org">ALL FM</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">South, central and east <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, UK</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>96.9 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a>, <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.allfm.org" class="external text">Online</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Community</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Independent</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>May 2000</td></tr></tbody></table> </td></tr></table><hr/>
