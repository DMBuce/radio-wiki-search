<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Galaxy_Digital --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Galaxy Digital</b> was a radio station broadcasting through the digital platform across the United Kingdom and was owned by Global Radio. It primarily broadcast in areas where Galaxy was not represented on FM, such as London, Leicester, Nottingham, and Derbyshire. It also formerly broadcast in Central Scotland, until the relaunch of Xfm Scotland as Galaxy Scotland, at which point Galaxy Digital on DAB was replaced with a relay of Xfm London. </p><p>The digital station was a 'sister' radio station to the local Galaxy Network services in various areas. The digital service was broadcast largely from the Galaxy Yorkshire studios, and much of the content networked across the group came from this location. </p><p>Since Monday 21 January 2008, Galaxy Digital was changed from its own dedicated service (albeit with mostly network content) to broadcast almost entirely as a direct relay of Galaxy Yorkshire, though the <i> 'Across Yorkshire' </i> on-air tagline was replaced by <i> 'Across the UK' </i> on the digital service. (Online listeners to the Galaxy Digital site got a direct feed of the Yorkshire service, with the Yorkshire tagline). Since Friday 21 March 2008, the radio station changed their <i> 'Passion for Music, Passion for Life' </i> strap-line slogan to <i> 'Love Music' </i>; the tagline changed again in 2010 to "The UK's Number One Hit Music Station" in preparation for the impending Capital relaunch (see below). </p><p>Galaxy Digital, as with the other Galaxy stations, specialised in Mainstream pop/dance/urban music with shows such as 'Hirsty's Daily Dose' in the mornings and James Barr in the evenings. Galaxy Digital often played cut-down versions of songs (usually recurrents) to fill in for all or part of the commercial break whilst the other Galaxy Stations played regional adverts. </p><p>In January 2011, Galaxy Digital ceased to operate, due to the merger of Galaxy stations into The Capital FM Network by Global Radio. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.galaxyfm.co.uk" class="external text">Galaxy FM</a><pre># galaxy digital (selected areas across the uk)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Galaxy Digital</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">Selected areas across the UK</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./DAB_Digital_Radio" title="DAB Digital Radio" class="mw-redirect">DAB Digital Radio</a> <br> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Online" title="Online" class="mw-redirect">Online</a> (Live Audio Stream)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Rhythmic_CHR" title="Rhythmic CHR" class="mw-redirect">Rhythmic CHR</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Galaxy_Radio" title="Galaxy Radio" class="mw-redirect">Galaxy Radio</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Global_Radio" title="Global Radio" class="mw-redirect">Global Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.galaxyfm.co.uk" class="external text">Galaxy FM</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
