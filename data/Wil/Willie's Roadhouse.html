<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Willie's_Roadhouse --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Willie's Roadhouse</b> (formerly <b>Willie's Place</b>) is a channel on the Sirius XM Radio that specializes in playing traditional country music, as well as some older country hit songs.  It is available on channel 59 (previously 56) and Dish Network 6059 (previously 6056), until The Highway took Willie's Roadhouse's former spot. </p><p>Until July 10, 2006, this channel was called "<b>Hank's Place</b>", named for Hank Williams.  When this was announced, XM did not explain why the name was changed.  Since then, however,  Willie Nelson's face has appeared in print advertising for XM, meaning that he has signed an endorsement deal, like those earlier signed by Bob Dylan and Snoop Dogg, as well as many other celebrity figures in all walks of life (e.g. Oprah Winfrey and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.). </p><p>It has since been announced that Nelson has taken over part ownership of the channel. </p><p>A program featuring cowboy poetry airs on Sunday nights. </p><p>On May 4, 2011, the channel was merged with The Roadhouse to make <i><b>Willie's Roadhouse</b></i>. As part of the merger, and in conjunction with the end of the Nashville! channel, the Grand Ole Opry moved its broadcasts to Willie's Roadhouse. </p><p>In 2018, it was announced that country artist Jeannie Seely would host a segment of the show on Sunday afternoons. "Iâ€™m so glad Jeannie Seely is on the Roadhouse. She is a good friend and will do a great job," commented Nelson.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.siriusxm.com/theroadhouse" class="external text">Willie's Roadhouse</a><pre># willie's roadhouse (united states canada)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">Willie's Roadhouse</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:Willie's_Roadhouse.png"><img resource="./File:Willie's_Roadhouse.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png/200px-Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png" data-file-width="840" data-file-height="298" data-file-type="bitmap" height="71" width="200" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png/300px-Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png/400px-Willie%27s_Roadhouse.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./United_States" title="United States">United States</a><br> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sirius_XM_Radio" title="Sirius XM Radio" class="mw-redirect">Sirius XM Radio</a> 59<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Dish_Network" title="Dish Network">Dish Network</a> 6059</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Honky-tonk#honky_tonk_music" title="Honky-tonk">Honky-Tonk</a> Country</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sirius_XM_Radio" title="Sirius XM Radio" class="mw-redirect">Sirius XM Radio</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Willie_Nelson" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2001 as <i>Hank's Place</i><br>July 10, 2006 as Willie's Place<br>May 4, 2011 as Willie's Roadhouse</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Satellite_Radio" title="Satellite Radio" class="mw-redirect">Satellite Radio</a> Station</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.siriusxm.com/theroadhouse" class="external text">Willie's Roadhouse</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
