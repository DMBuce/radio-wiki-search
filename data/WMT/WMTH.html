<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WMTH --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WMTH-FM</b>, located in Park Ridge, Illinois, was among the first FM high school radio stations in the United States when it was licensed in 1959. Established by the Student Council at Maine Township High School, now Maine East High School, the station went on the air during December 1959.  The station became known as "The Voice of Maine Township". </p><p>The radio station was built by electronics teacher, Theron Whitfield, and electronics students in the school. The first student voice on the station was that of class of 1960 senior, Harrison Ford, who went on to become a major film actor in the <i>Star Wars</i> and the <i>Indiana Jones</i> film series. </p><p>WMTH-FM has studios at all three existing Maine Township High Schools; Maine West High School in Des Plaines and Maine East High School and Maine South High School in Park Ridge. There was also a studio at the former Maine North High School in Des Plaines. </p><p>The call letters were chosen "MTH" as in <b>M</b>aine <b>T</b>ownship <b>H</b>igh (school). The WMTH-FM antenna is located on the highest point of the school building at Dempster and Potter Roads in Park Ridge. The studio from 1959 through 1970 was located in room 147B, across the hall from the auditorium. When the center courtyard building opened in the fall of 1970, the radio station relocated and the first WMTH-TV television studio was built. </p><p>The original power of the station was 16 watts effective radiated power at a frequency of 88.5 MHz. This continued from 1960 until 1983 when the frequency was changed to 90.5 MHz and the power reduced to 10 watts. This leaves it as one of the lowest powered FM stations in the United States, and one of few remaining under the now-discontinued Class D license. </p><p>WMTH-FM continues to broadcast a mixture of music, school sports events, and other programs of local interest. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://13.bteradio.com:9090/wmth.mp3" class="external free">http://13.bteradio.com:9090/wmth.mp3</a> Listen Live]<pre># wmth (park ridge, illinois)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WMTH</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:WMTH-FM_logo.png"><img resource="./File:WMTH-FM_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/WMTH-FM_logo.png" data-file-width="197" data-file-height="115" data-file-type="bitmap" height="115" width="197"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Park_Ridge,_Illinois" title="Park Ridge, Illinois">Park Ridge</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>90.5 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>The Voice of Maine Township</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./High_school_radio" title="High school radio">High School</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Board of Education, Maine Township #207</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>December 20, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./1959_in_radio" title="1959 in radio">1959</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>M</b>aine <b>T</b>ownship <b>H</b>igh</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>6050</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">D</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>8 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>31 meters (102 feet)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Transmitter coordinates</div></th><td><span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=WMTH&amp;params=42_02_14_N_87_51_30_W_" class="external text"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">42°02′14″N</span> <span class="longitude">87°51′30″W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">42.03722°N 87.85833°W</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">42.03722; -87.85833</span></span></span></a></span></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://13.bteradio.com:9090/wmth.mp3" class="external free">http://13.bteradio.com:9090/wmth.mp3</a> Listen Live]</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://south.maine207.org/activities/wmth/" class="external text">WMTH Online</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
