<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Weatheradio_Canada --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Weatheradio Canada</b> (French: <i lang="fr">Radiométéo Canada</i>) is a Canadian weather radio network that is owned and operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada division. The network transmits in both official languages (English and French) from 230 sites across Canada. Weatheradio Canada like their telephone service, uses the Starcaster Text to Speech, which has been used for many years and is owned by STR-SpeechTech Ltd. </p><p>In most locations, the service broadcasts on one of seven specially-allocated VHF radio frequencies, audible only on dedicated "weather band" receivers or any VHF radio capable of receiving 10 kHz bandwidth FM signals centered on these assigned channels, which are located within the larger "public service band". The radio frequencies used by Weatheradio Canada are the same as those used by its American counterpart, NOAA Weather Radio, and receivers designed for use in one country are compatible for use in the other. Since 2004, the service has used Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) alerting technology to disseminate severe weather bulletins. Weatheradio has indicated that, in the future, it also plans to add other hazard and civil emergency information (such as natural disasters, technological accidents, AMBER alerts and terrorist attacks) to its broadcasts.</p><p>In some locations, primarily national parks, provincial parks and remote communities with little or no local media service, a transmitter operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation carries the service on a standard AM or FM broadcast frequency. As of August 2007, most of these AM and FM transmitters were unlicensed by the CRTC under a special license exemption granted to low-power non-commercial broadcasters.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=792F2D20-1" class="external text">Weatheradio Canada</a><pre># weatheradio canada (unknown location)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">Weatheradio Canada</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>162.4<span typeof="mw:Entity">–</span>162.55 MHz</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Weather_radio" title="Weather radio">Weather radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Environment_and_Climate_Change_Canada" title="Environment and Climate Change Canada">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a> / <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Meteorological_Service_of_Canada" title="Meteorological Service of Canada">Meteorological Service of Canada</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=792F2D20-1" class="external text">Weatheradio Canada</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
