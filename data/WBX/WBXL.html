WBXL has been broadcasting since late 1975. Most of the student DJs shows occurred during the school day or in evenings before 11pm. Later on, the station started broadcasting 24/7 (since October 2012). </p><p>WBXL can be heard by listeners in the Syracuse, New York area. The station is housed inside Charles W. Baker High School in Baldwinsville and is student-operated. </p><p>WBXL was started by Al Jenner, a former teacher at Baker High and Mark Humphrey, a student. The station acquired its first transmitter from the Fayetteville-Manlius School District, after acquiring it from WAER-FM, Syracuse University.  The transmitter was a low power unit (10–100 watts). Over the years the station grew and became an integral part of the school culture. Eventually, a class was created around the radio station. The class was centered on teaching students effective communication techniques as well as broadcasting history and the intricacies of radio broadcasting.  </p><p>WBXL has a student administration consisting of: General Manager, Music Director, Mix Team, and Talk Show Hosts. </p><p>Due to the varying tastes of music within teenage culture today, WBXL boasts a huge variety of musical genres, from jazz to metal.
