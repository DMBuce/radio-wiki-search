<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Zed_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>Zed Radio</b> "The Online Party Station" was a very popular online Dance Hits web radio station based in Zaporizhia, Ukraine.  It was founded in June 2003 and operated only a few hours per week. </p><p>In June 2004, after a legal dispute over an American group of broadcasters bringing the Europa Plus network to the USA, the American broadcasters joined up with Zed Radio and turned the station into a full-time Dance Hits/Chill Out format. Zed Radio now had a new studio in the USA. Zed Radio produced a very popular metal show <b>Mandatory Metal</b> hosted by DJ Zombie, which can now be heard on Surge Radio. </p><p>In September 2004, the Ukraine-based Zed Radio was threatened with lawsuits for rebroadcasting shows Garage, EuroMix, and Euro-Hit Top 40 from Europa Plus without permission. Later, Zed Radio refocused its format, leaning more to a Hot AC format. The USA Department built another studio in Antelope Valley, and the Ukraine Department rented a professional radio studio from TRK Grani. </p><p>In November 2004, Zed Radio joined forces with Dimension's DJing and DJ CM3 became the new music director. DJ CM3 flipped the station to a Dance/Hip Hop format, going against the wishes of General Manager Yegor Veklich. </p><p>In March 2005, the General Manager dismissed the USA Department from Zed Radio's operations. The two departments went their separate ways: the Ukraine Department became Dance Hits Radio Galaktika while the USA Department became Dance/Hip Hop Surge Radio. </p><p>WDOS-FM picked up Zed Radio's unique dance format on their Friday and Saturday Night Dance Parties. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Zed Radio">Google Search</a><pre># zed radio (zaporizhia, ukraine)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">Zed Radio</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:Zedradio.png"><img resource="./File:Zedradio.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Zedradio.png" data-file-width="166" data-file-height="91" data-file-type="bitmap" height="110" width="200"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Zaporizhia" title="Zaporizhia" class="mw-redirect">Zaporizhia</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Dance_Hits" title="Dance Hits" class="mw-redirect">Dance Hits</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Yegor_Veklich" title="Yegor Veklich" class="new">Yegor Veklich</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>June 2003</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
