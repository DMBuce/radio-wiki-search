<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KFSD --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>   <p><b>KFSD</b> (1450 AM) is a radio station based in North County, San Diego, California. It is owned by North County Broadcasting Corp. and is currently off the air. The station's studios are located in Carlsbad, while the transmitter is located in an industrial park in Escondido.</p><p>From 2004 until February 1, 2007, KFSD was a classical music radio station. </p><p>KFSD stands for "First in San Diego," dating back to the first commercial broadcast license in San Diego. The KFSD call letters were originally assigned in 1926 to AM 620 (later 600). The KFSD call sign was on 600 from 1926–1963. KFSD was also on FM 94.1 from 1948 to 1963, then re-appeared on 94.1 in 1973 until 1997. The KFSD-TV call sign was on Channel 10 from 1953–1963. The three KFSD stations switched to the KOGO call sign in 1963, as information about San Diego and its people were fed into a new IBM computer and asked for the perfect call letters for these stations, and it chose KOGO. </p><p>The last iteration of KFSD-FM 94.1 was as a classical station. KFSD had a good solid audience, but the station was bought by Nationwide Communications (division of Nationwide Insurance). Nationwide felt a change to more aggressive music was a better choice for the only 100 kW station in San Diego. KFSD was changed to KXGL, and became the Eagle 94.1. The Eagle's format proved to be a failure, and in 1998 became KJQY/KJOY 94.1. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=KFSD">Google Search</a><pre># kfsd (escondido, california)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt6" id="mwCw"><caption class="fn org">KFSD</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Escondido,_California" title="Escondido, California">Escondido, California</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./San_Diego_County,_California" title="San Diego County, California">San Diego County</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1450 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kilohertz" title="Kilohertz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./North_County_Broadcasting_Corp." title="North County Broadcasting Corp." class="new">North County Broadcasting Corp.</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1957 (as KOWN)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>KOWN (1957-1987)<br>KOWA (1987-1990)<br>KSPA (1990-2001)<br>KFSD (2001-2002)<br>KSPA (4/2002-8/2002)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>K</b> "First in <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./San_Diego" title="San Diego"><b>S</b>an <b>D</b>iego</a>" (from 1926 when the calls were on AM 600 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KOGO_(AM)" title="KOGO (AM)">KOGO</a>)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>49205</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">C</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>1,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
