<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KXAL-LP --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>KXAL-LP</b> (104.7 FM) was a low-power radio station licensed to Chalk Hill Community, Texas, United States. The station aired a format consisting of classical music and jazz, and was owned by The Church at Lake Cherokee.</p><p>104.7 KXAL-LP signed on in 2002 as KZQX-LP, owned by Chalk Hill Educational Media and airing an adult standards format. Principals of Chalk Hill Educational Media then acquired KXAL-FM (100.3 MHz) in 2009; as a result, they had to divest the low-power FM license, which was sold to The Church at Lake Cherokee and changed to a light classical and jazz format. The sale was finalized in November 2009, and at that time 104.7 became KXAL-LP and 100.3 became KZQX. </p><p>On May 1, 2018, the station turned in its license for cancellation stating that "it has become obvious...that KXAL-LP has outlived its usefulness" and that the owners had searched unsuccessfully for a new owner to donate the station to. The Federal Communications Commission cancelled the license on May 24, 2018. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=KXAL-LP">Google Search</a><pre># kxal-lp (longview, texas metropolitan area)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">KXAL-LP</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Longview,_Texas_metropolitan_area" title="Longview, Texas metropolitan area" class="mw-redirect">Longview, Texas metropolitan area</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>The Classical One</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td>Classical by Day, Jazz By Night</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Classical, jazz music</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>The Church at Lake Cherokee</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2003</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Last air date</div></th><td>2018</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>KZQX-LP (2002â€“2009)</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td>Former call letters of <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KZQX" title="KZQX">100.3 FM</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">L1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>74 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>34.9455 meters</td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
