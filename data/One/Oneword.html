<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Oneword --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Oneword Radio</b> was a British commercial digital radio station featuring books, drama, comedy, children's programming, and discussion. The station was available in the UK via digital radio (DAB) and digital television (Freeview DVB-T and Sky Digital DVB-S) and was streamed on the internet 24 hours a day worldwide. It was launched on 2 May 2000.</p><p>Ownership was shared between UBC Media Group and Channel 4 between early 2005 and December 2007. In October 2005, Channel 4 increased its stake to a majority by buying 51% of Oneword for £1 million. At 7.30 on weekday mornings, Oneword carried the Channel 4 Radio daily news broadcast, The Morning Report, which was produced by the Channel 4 news team. </p><p>Virgin Media removed OneWord from their ex-NTL cable channel lineup on 4 October 2007. Oneword was not on their ex-Telewest lineup at the time. </p><p>In December 2007, Channel 4 decided to withdraw its funding, selling its share back to UBC Media Group for £1. All programming was replaced by repeats of previous output. On 1 January 2008 the remaining staff were dismissed. Oneword ceased broadcasting on DAB on Friday 11 January 2008.</p><p>After broadcasting ended, birdsong was broadcast on the channel until a permanent replacement, Amazing Radio, came on air on 1 June 2009. It has been claimed that the audience for the station was higher while the birdsong was playing than when the station was broadcasting normally.</p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071024111300/http://www.oneword.co.uk/" class="external text">www.oneword.co.uk</a><pre># oneword  (united kingdom)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt4" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Oneword <i>(Defunct)</i></caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Digital_audio_broadcasting" title="Digital audio broadcasting" class="mw-redirect">DAB</a>: 11D (<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Digital_One" title="Digital One">Digital One</a>)<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Freeview_(UK)" title="Freeview (UK)">Freeview</a>: 717<br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sky_Digital_(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)" class="mw-redirect">Sky Digital</a>: 0127</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Speech</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./UBC_Media_Group" title="UBC Media Group">UBC Media Group</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071024111300/http://www.oneword.co.uk/" class="external text">www.oneword.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
