<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WRVC_(AM) --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WRVC</b> is the oldest operating radio station in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was originally called WSAZ Radio (see WSAZ), the same call letters used for Channel 3 TV when it came into being in the late 1940s, and the television station still uses that long-time call.  WRVC AM &amp; FM is located in Huntington, West Virginia and is West Virginia's oldest continually licensed station. It began operations on October 16, 1923 as WSAZ in Pomeroy, Ohio at the Chase Electric Shop. The station was moved to Huntington, W.V. in 1927, moved to 930 AM in 1941 and has been there ever since, changing to WGNT in the 1970s and to WRVC in the 1990s.  Currently it markets itself as "ESPN 94.1 FM &amp; AM 930" since August 2016 and before that, the addition of an FM translator and change of the format to talk/sports (as "Supertalk 94.1 FM and AM 930") was first made in May 2009. </p><p>WRVC is currently owned by Kindred Communications, and was the primary AM station in the market for many years. Nationally owned competitor Clear Channel moved Rush Limbaugh and the Cincinnati Reds to WVHU, whereupon WRVC 930 AM joined Air America Radio network in 2004.  In November 2006, WRVC became an almost 24/7 sports station for about three years, but also carried local music and church on weekends and daily local talk. "Supertalk" was a mix of news, talk and sports on May 18, 2009, the approximate of lineup mix the station had prior to 2006. </p><p>In 2014, the station once again went back to ESPN as its main programming, with MetroNews providing state talk, the Statewide Sportsline and other sports programming from ESPN, Westwood One, the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Cavaliers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Programming also includes "The Drive" hosted by Paul Swann, a local sports talk show that airs weekdays 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. and won Best Talk Show in a ranked market at the 2019 West Virginia Broadcasters Association's Excellence in Broadcasting Awards. </p><p>WRVC also carries many local sports including Marshall football, men's basketball and baseball, as well as high school sports from Huntington High School, since 2013.  It also carries nationally syndicated games from Major League Baseball, the National Football League and playoffs up to and including the Super Bowl and the National Basketball League, as well as NCAA Basketball and "March Madness" Championships along with many college bowl games, including the BCS Championship and other BCS Bowls. </p><b>URL:</b> <span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://wrvc.com/" class="external text">wrvc<wbr></wbr>.com</a></span><pre># wrvc (huntington, west virginia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">WRVC</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:WRVC_ESPN930-94.1_logo.png"><img resource="./File:WRVC_ESPN930-94.1_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/WRVC_ESPN930-94.1_logo.png" data-file-width="180" data-file-height="101" data-file-type="bitmap" height="101" width="180"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Huntington,_West_Virginia" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Huntington,_West_Virginia" title="Huntington, West Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ashland,_Kentucky" title="Ashland, Kentucky">Ashland, Kentucky</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Ironton,_Ohio" title="Ironton, Ohio">Ironton, Ohio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>930 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kilohertz" title="Kilohertz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td><i>ESPN Huntington 94.1 FM and AM 930</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sports_radio" title="Sports radio">Sports</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Cincinnati_Bengals_Radio_Network" title="Cincinnati Bengals Radio Network">Cincinnati Bengals Radio Network</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Cleveland_Cavaliers_Radio_Network" title="Cleveland Cavaliers Radio Network">Cleveland Cavaliers Radio Network</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Pittsburgh_Pirates_Radio_Network" title="Pittsburgh Pirates Radio Network">Pittsburgh Pirates Radio Network</a><br><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./ESPN_Radio" title="ESPN Radio">ESPN Radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Fifth Avenue Broadcasting Company, Inc.
