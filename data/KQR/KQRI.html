<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KQRI --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>KQRI</b> (105.5 MHz) is a radio station licensed to Bosque Farms, New Mexico. It covers Albuquerque and Valencia County. It is a non-commercial station owned by Educational Media Foundation broadcasting its "Air 1" Christian Worship music format. </p><p>KQRI is one of the newest additions to the Albuquerque radio market, having moved into the area in 2004 from Grants, New Mexico. The 105.5 frequency in Albuquerque was previously translator K288CX, which had re-broadcast the programming on various stations in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe market over the years. In 2015, more than decade after being displaced, the translator moved to 107.5 as K298BY rebroadcasting KIVA 1600. In 2012, KQRI-FM1, a 16,000 watt effective radiated power booster on 105.5 in Albuquerque came on the air. </p><p>105.5 was originally KQLV and had aired EMF's "K-Love" format. In the spring of 2009, KQLV had moved to the recently upgraded facility at 90.7 FM Santa Fe. KQRI and the "Air 1" format had previously aired on 90.7 in Belen, which had moved to 91.1 to make way for the Santa Fe station on 90.7. KQRI moved to 105.5 in June 2009 while 91.1 became KQGC airing a Christian country music format. Since this change, KQRI is now vying for area listeners with locally programmed heritage station KLYT previously known as "M88". That station, however, had rebranded as "Static Radio" in 2011 playing Christian rock bands alongside some selected secular alternative rock songs. In April 2015 it rebranded again as "Star 88". </p><p>On December 1, 2015, KQRI had been rebroadcasting on translator K233CG 94.5 in Albuquerque. The EMF owned translator had previously been leased since 2011 to KRKE 1550 (now KQNM) which aired an 80's hits format until late September 2015. KQRI had previously used the translator from 2009-2011 when it broadcast at 89.5 as K208EO although it did not really provide any additional coverage for KQRI. In late June 2016 EMF sold the translator to Martha Whitman for $61,432.66. Martha Whitman is the owner of KOAZ 1510 AM and translator K279BP which rebroadcasts KOAZ. The sale was consummated on August 15, 2016 at which time the broadcast on 94.5 ceased. The translator now airs programming from KKOB (AM). </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.air1.com/listen/" class="external text">Listen Live</a><pre># kqri (bosque farms, new mexico)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBA"><caption class="fn org">KQRI</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Air1-logo_(1).png"><img resource="./File:Air1-logo_(1).png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Air1-logo_%281%29.png" data-file-width="160" data-file-height="73" data-file-type="bitmap" height="73" width="160"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bosque_Farms,_New_Mexico" title="Bosque Farms, New Mexico">Bosque Farms, New Mexico</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label">Albuquerque and Central New Mexico</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>105.5 (MHz)</td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Air 1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td><i>Worship Now</i></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Christian_Worship" title="Christian Worship" class="mw-redirect">Christian Worship</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Affiliations</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Air1" title="Air1">Air1</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Educational_Media_Foundation" title="Educational Media Foundation">Educational Media Foundation</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sister_station" title="Sister station">Sister stations</a></div></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KQLV_(FM)" title="KQLV (FM)">KQLV</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KQGC" title="KQGC">KQGC</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>2004</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>KQLV (1998-2009)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>84247</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">C1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>100,000 watts</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>227 meters</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Webcast" title="Webcast">Webcast</a></th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.air1.com/listen/" class="external text">Listen Live</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.air1.com" class="external text">air1.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
