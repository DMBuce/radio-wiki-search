<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WJUC --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WJUC</b> ("The Juice") is a commercial Urban contemporary music radio station in Swanton, Ohio, broadcasting to the Swanton, Ohio-Toledo, Ohio area on 107.3 FM.  The station's studios are located in Toledo, and its transmitter is located north of Swanton. </p><p>WJUC, which began broadcasting in 1997, was the first African-American owned-and-operated radio station in the Toledo market and is one of the few radio stations in the area that is still locally owned and operated.  "The Juice" began as a station playing a wide variety of musical styles appealing to African-American listeners, including rap, soul oldies, gospel music, and blues.  Today, the station's playlist consists almost exclusively of R&amp;B and urban contemporary hits, aside from a Sunday-morning gospel music show. </p><p>WJUC is the brainchild of Charles "Charlie Chuck" Welch, a former disc jockey at the now-defunct WKLR-FM (now WKKO).  Welch is said to be proud that his station is still live and local and has reportedly declined offers from larger broadcasters to buy his station. </p><p>WJUC primarily competes with Urban Radio Broadcasting's WJZE-FM (Hot 97.3) for the ears of hip-hop listeners in Toledo.  The Juice's ratings have fallen in recent years due to competition from WJZE, which is now usually the higher-rated (12+) of the two stations.  WJUC also suffers from a signal that becomes scratchy in the eastern portion of the Toledo metro area and under certain weather conditions is sometimes swamped by co-channel interference from WNWV-FM in Elyria, Ohio, although the station continues to enjoy respectable ratings despite its limited reach. </p><p>Effective May 25, 2017, Welch Communications assigned the license for WJUC to Fleming Street Communications, Inc., a corporation controlled by Charles Welch's children. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.thejuice1073.com/" class="external free">http://www.thejuice1073.com/</a><pre># wjuc (swanton, ohio)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt2" id="mwBQ"><caption class="fn org">WJUC</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png"><img resource="./File:WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png/220px-WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png" data-file-width="407" data-file-height="242" data-file-type="bitmap" height="131" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png/330px-WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/WJUC_TheJuice107.3_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Swanton,_Ohio" title="Swanton, Ohio">Swanton, Ohio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Toledo,_Ohio" title="Toledo, Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>107.3 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">MHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>"The Juice 107.3"</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Slogan" title="Slogan">Slogan</a></th><td><b>Hits From Back in The Day &amp; Today</b></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Urban_contemporary" title="Urban contemporary">Urban contemporary</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Fleming Street Communications, Inc.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>1997</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Call_sign" title="Call sign">Call sign</a> meaning</div></th><td><b>JU</b>i<b>C</b>e</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">A</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>3,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Height_above_average_terrain" title="Height above average terrain">HAAT</a></th><td>100 meters</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.thejuice1073.com/" class="external free">http://www.thejuice1073.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
