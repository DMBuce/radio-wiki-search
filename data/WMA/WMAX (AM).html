<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/WMAX_(AM) --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>WMAX</b> (1440 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Catholic religious format. It is co-owned with WDEO 990 AM in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and features the same programming from the EWTN Global Catholic Radio network. </p><p>Licensed to Bay City, Michigan, it first began broadcasting in 1925 under the <b>WSKC</b> call sign, at 1150 kHz. It was the first radio station in the Tri-Cities and first Michigan radio station north of Flint. In 1930, the call sign changed to <b>WBCM</b>, followed by a shift in frequency in 1941 to 1440 kHz. <b>WBCM</b> served the Bay City area as a local station for many years with a variety of formats including MOR and country music.</p><p><b>WBCM</b> began experimenting with FM Radio in 1947, one of the first in the region. WBCM-FM was located at 96.1 mHz and broadcast from an over 300 foot Blaw-Knox tower at the station's Bay City east side studio on Tuscola Rd, initially signing on in 1947. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 96.1 FM broadcast a beautiful music format.  Purchased by Liggett Communications earlier in 1973, on August 27, 1973 the FM calls were changed to <b>WHNN</b> and the station adopted a Top 40 format as "Super Win." Later, Liggett built a new FM tower location in Quanicassee to alleviate a short spaced situation with WHTC-FM Holland, and the power was upped to a legal maximum of 100,000 watts. </p><p>Liggett changed the AM format to country and changed call letters to  <b>WRDD</b> (Big Red Radio) and build a new 5 KW AM directional site for the station along M-84 in southern Frankenlust Township, Michigan, Upon license approval of the new AM facility he sold <b>WRDD</b> to a local broadcast concern who returned the calls to <b>WBCM</b>. The station would go through another ownership change and change of  call letters  briefly to <b>WUNI</b> (You and I) to <b>WMAX</b> in 1992 and simulcast sports-talk station WTRX of Flint. WMAX is of no relation to WMAX-FM 96.1, an IHeartMedia-owned radio station in Holland, Michigan. The simulcast only lasted about ten years when it was then sold to the current Catholic radio operator. </p><p>WMAX is also the former call sign of an AM station at 1480 kHz in Grand Rapids, Michigan (now WGVU-AM). </p><p>Until April 2018, WMAX's programming was simulcast on WHHQ AM 1250, a station based in Bridgeport that covered much of the same broadcasting area as WMAX. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.avemariaradio.net/" class="external text">http://www.avemariaradio.net/</a><pre># wmax (bay city, michigan)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">WMAX</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:WDEO-AM.jpg"><img resource="./File:WDEO-AM.jpg" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/WDEO-AM.jpg" data-file-width="150" data-file-height="40" data-file-type="bitmap" height="40" width="150"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bay_City,_Michigan" title="Bay City, Michigan">Bay City, Michigan</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Saginaw,_Michigan" title="Saginaw, Michigan">Saginaw</a>-<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bay_City,_Michigan" title="Bay City, Michigan">Bay City</a>-<a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Midland,_Michigan" title="Midland, Michigan">Midland</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1440 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KHz" title="KHz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr class="note"><th scope="row">Branding</th><td>Ave Maria Radio</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Religious" title="Religious" class="mw-redirect">Religious</a>; <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Catholic" title="Catholic" class="mw-redirect">Catholic</a> based talk/sermons</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Word_Broadcasters" title="Word Broadcasters" class="new">Word Broadcasters</a> <br>(AM Media Services)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>April 23, 1925</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Former call signs</div></th><td>WUNI (7/30/91-7/30/92)<br>WRDD (1977-1979)<br>WBCM (1930-1977 and 1979-1991)<br>WSKC (1925-1930)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">B</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>5,000 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> (Daytime)<br>2,500 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> (Nighttime)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.avemariaradio.net/" class="external text">http://www.avemariaradio.net/</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
