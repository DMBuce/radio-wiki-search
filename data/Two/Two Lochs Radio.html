<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Two_Lochs_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Two Lochs Radio</b> is Britain's smallest commercial radio station, and community broadcaster for the Gairloch, Loch Ewe and Loch Maree areas of Wester Ross, in the Highlands of Scotland. The station broadcasts in stereo on 106.0 and 106.6<span> </span>MHz FM. It also provides the Lochbroom FM service for the Ullapool and Coigach areas on 96.8 and 102.2<span> </span>MHz FM. </p><p>For about 60 hours per week the station broadcasts programmes produced by volunteer presenters and partner stations, with the remaining airtime occupied by digital services Smooth Radio Glasgow during the day and Magic 105.4 or Smooth Radio Glasgow overnight. </p><p>In April 2008, Two Lochs Radio also launched an online "Listen live" streaming service, accessible from a button on its homepage, and also in the Reciva database for Internet radios. In January 2012, Two Lochs Radio joined the large number of UK commercial and BBC stations also available via the UK Radioplayer. It is also available on the TuneIn online radio system. Unusually, Two Lochs Radio also provides simple telephone listening by ordinary phone call to 0330 998 1114 (UK) or 518 500 1063 (US) - this service is limited to telephone audio quality, but doesn't require FM reception or Internet connection to be available. </p><p>Two Lochs Radio's programme schedule includes daily breakfast and afternoon shows, plus a range of individual music and local interest programmes, including Gaelic broadcasts and recordings from local events. The station also broadcasts Gaelic programmes produced by CKJM-FM in Cape Breton, and shows from several other independent Scottish radio presenters. </p><p>Two Lochs Radio was named "Calor Scottish Business in the Community Business" award in 2004, and is a three-times winner of the Wallace Sword award for the best Gaelic magazine programme produced by a Highland community radio station. It was also nominated for the Scottish Countryside Alliance rural enterprise award in 2009.</p><p>The station operates on a not-for-profit basis for the benefit of the community, and is dependent on advertising, local fundraising and donors for its continuing existence. Membership of the station is open to all who support its aims. </p><p>Two Lochs Radio is currently developing plans for expansion of its service to a larger part of Wester Ross currently not served by any local radio. This would cover the communities around Little Loch Broom, Loch Torridon and Achnasheen. However this project is subject to the station raising sufficient funding, particularly to sustain the ongoing increased costs of four additional relay sites. </p><b>URL:</b> <a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.2lr.co.uk/" class="external text">www.2LR.co.uk</a><pre># two lochs radio (gairloch)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Two Lochs Radio</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:Image/Frameless"><a href="./File:Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg"><img resource="./File:Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg/220px-Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg" data-file-width="640" data-file-height="480" data-file-type="bitmap" height="165" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg/330px-Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg/440px-Two_Lochs_Radio_-_geograph.org.uk_-_747711.jpg 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td>Gairloch</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Wester_Ross" title="Wester Ross">Wester Ross</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>106.0 MHz, 106.6 MHz (96.8 MHz &amp; 102.2 MHz in Lochbroom area)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Community info &amp; mixed music</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Community_owned" title="Community owned" class="mw-redirect">Community owned</a> through Wester Ross Radio Ltd</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>22 November 2003</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Effective_radiated_power" title="Effective radiated power">ERP</a></th><td>0.6 kW &amp; 2 kW (0.7 kW &amp; 0.5 kW in Lochbroom area)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="https://www.2lr.co.uk/" class="external text">www.2LR.co.uk</a></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
