<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/KNGL --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p><b>KNGL</b> (1540 AM) is a radio station licensed to McPherson, Kansas, United States. The station is currently owned by Davies Communications.</p><p>The station first went on the air Jan. 4, 1949 as KNEX. KNEX operated out of a two-story farm house south of McPherson, known as the Crumpacker place. The first owners in 1949 were Ken Krebhiel (who also owned The Republican newspaper), Paul Sargent of Peoples Bank and Trust, John Griffith, owner of Friends Drug Store, and Everette Mills, a McPherson attorney. </p><p>KNEX' most enduring employee was Claude Hughes, who came to McPherson from Garden City. He began as the station's first engineer in 1949. But he quickly moved up to station manager by 1956. "Cousin' Claude", as his listeners called him, hosted a number of programs, including "Sunny Side of the Street." And he reported McPherson's weather conditions from the "Weather Garden". Claude worked for the station until his death in 2003. </p><p>Another notable voice on the station was Bob Hapgood, who Claude Hughes hired in 1968. Bob was the leader of a popular regional band called King Midas and the Mufflers. He would draw on his experience as drummer for the band to host an oldies show on KNEX for many years. </p><p>Initially the station had both an AM and FM license, but dropped the FM license because few people had FM radios in the 1950s. Later, in 1980, an FM license was re-issued for KNEX-FM. </p><p>In 1979 new owners took over the stations and chose call letters inspired by their names, Joe Engle (KNGL) and Bernard Brown (KBBE-FM). </p><p>In 1985, Jerry and Diane Davies, dba Davies Communications, acquired the two stations. </p><b>URL:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=KNGL">Google Search</a><pre># kngl (mcpherson, kansas)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt1" id="mwAw"><caption class="fn org">KNGL</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_license" title="City of license">City</a></th><td><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./McPherson,_Kansas" title="McPherson, Kansas">McPherson</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>1540 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./KHz" title="KHz" class="mw-redirect">kHz</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Davies Communications</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Facility_ID" title="Facility ID">Facility ID</a></th><td>15840</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category">D</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Transmitter_power_output" title="Transmitter power output">Power</a></th><td>250 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> day<br>2 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> night</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">Transmitter coordinates</div></th><td><span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=KNGL&amp;params=38_20_30.00_N_97_40_12.00_W_region:US_type:city" class="external text"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">38°20′30.00″N</span> <span class="longitude">97°40′12.00″W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">38.3416667°N 97.6700000°W</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">38.3416667; -97.6700000</span></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span id="coordinates"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Geographic_coordinate_system" title="Geographic coordinate system">Coordinates</a>: <span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=KNGL&amp;params=38_20_30.00_N_97_40_12.00_W_region:US_type:city" class="external text"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">38°20′30.00″N</span> <span class="longitude">97°40′12.00″W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span></span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">38.3416667°N 97.6700000°W</span><span style="display:none"><span typeof="mw:Entity">﻿</span> / <span class="geo">38.3416667; -97.6700000</span></span></span></a></span></span></span><link rel="mw:PageProp/Category" href="./Category:Coordinates_on_Wikidata"></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
