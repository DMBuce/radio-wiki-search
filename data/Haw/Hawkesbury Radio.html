<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Hawkesbury_Radio --><table><tr><td style='vertical-align:top'><p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Hawkesbury Radio</b> (call sign: <b>2VTR</b>) was a fully licensed community radio station until the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) refused to renew its full-time broadcast licence in late 2017.  Hawkesbury Radio was one of only two community stations Australia-wide to lose their licence.  After several years of investigations, ACMA cited failure to involve the community in its operations as the reason for the loss of licence. (ACMA has since granted 4 different groups TEMPORARY broadcast licences, all broadcasting on the same 89.9 FM frequency). </p><p>Hawkesbury Radio's primary purpose was supposed to be to serve the residents of the Australian City of Hawkesbury, but ACMA's refusal to renew their licence in effect questioned the station's ability and willingness to do this.   Hawkesbury Radio broadcasts on the frequency 89.9 FM. The station is staffed by volunteers and broadcasts live for a very limited time each week under the terms of their temporary broadcast licence.. Hawkesbury Radio was the only Community Radio Station in Australia to have Broadcast rights of NRL which featured Penrith Panthers NRL matches, from 1997 to 2009. In 2016 the station gained broadcast rights to Western Sydney Wanderers A-League matches as well as W-League, National Youth League and FFA Cup matches involving the Wanderers</p><p>Hawkesbury Radio began in 1978 with a test broadcast, gaining its full licence in 1982, one of the first local community radio licences granted.  The station broadcast out of a tiny condemned building, which housed the studio and transmitter in Fitzgerald Street Windsor for many years, before moving to its current site in 1992 in an adjacent building.  Hawkesbury Radio originally broadcast on 89.7 MHz, but moved to its current frequency of 89.9 MHz in December 1999.</p><b>URL:</b> <span class="official-website"><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.hawkesburyradio.com.au" class="external text">Official website</a></span></span><pre># hawkesbury radio 89.9 fm (hawkesbury, sydney, nsw, australia)</pre></td><td><table class="infobox vcard" style="width:22em" about="#mwt5" id="mwCA"><caption class="fn org">Hawkesbury Radio 89.9 FM</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><figure-inline typeof="mw:Image"><a href="./File:Hawk_radio_logo.png"><img resource="./File:Hawk_radio_logo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Hawk_radio_logo.png/200px-Hawk_radio_logo.png" data-file-width="268" data-file-height="96" data-file-type="bitmap" height="72" width="200" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Hawk_radio_logo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Hawk_radio_logo.png 2x"></a></figure-inline></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Broadcast area</th><td class="label"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./City_of_Hawkesbury" title="City of Hawkesbury">Hawkesbury</a>, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, NSW, Australia</td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a></th><td>89.9 <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Megahertz" title="Megahertz" class="mw-redirect">mHz</a> <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Programming</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Radio_format" title="Radio format">Format</a></th><td class="category">Mixed</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Ownership</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Owner</th><td>Hawkesbury Radio Communications Cooperative Society Limited</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">History</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div style="display:inline-block; padding:0.1em 0;line-height:1.2em;">First air date</div></th><td>circa 1978</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Technical information</th></tr><tr><th scope="row"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">Class</a></th><td class="category"><a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Community_radio" title="Community radio">Community radio</a></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center;background-color: #efefef;">Links</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Website</th><td><span class="official-website"><span class="url"><a rel="mw:ExtLink" href="http://www.hawkesburyradio.com.au" class="external text">Official website</a></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>  </td></tr></table><hr/>
